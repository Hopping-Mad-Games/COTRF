Make sure to give your character a name and decide what they look like.

If you are creating a character for the firsttime, it can be helpful to work with your game master\n\n(GM) to choose options that make a good play experience.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEPCHARACTER CREATION\n\nThese are the steps needed to create your character.\n\nSTEP 0. GATHER MATERIALS\n\nMake sure these basic tools are handy to record yourcharacter choices:\n\nâ€¢ pencil\n\nâ€¢ blank character sheet\n\nâ€¢ scratch paper\n\nâ€¢ dice (see About Those Dice in the sidebar)\n\nABOUT THOSE DICE\n\nThe Black Flag Roleplaying system uses polyhedraldice to resolve actions. These dice are abbreviatedin game text, so a four-sided die is a d4, a six-sideddie is a d6, and so on for d8, d10, d12, and d20.Percentile dice rolls (1-100) are rolled with two diceand abbreviated d%.\n\nSTEP 1. CREATE A CHARACTER CONCEPT\n\nIt can help to think about what kind of character you wantto play before you start picking from lists. Do you want\n\nto cast magic spells? Do you want to be good at swinging\n\na sword? Do you want to play as a human or a member ofsome more fantastical lineage? Knowing what sounds likefun to you can help guide your decisions.\n\nTalk to the other players about your ideas if theyrearound. Hearing what other players have in mind canhelp focus your choices or inspire you to create a conceptthat works well with other adventurers in your party.\n\nFor example, if all the other PCs are rough-and-tumblewarriors, you might want to make a cleric so you can patchthem up with healing magic!\n\nSTEP 2. CHOOSE A CLASS\n\nChoosing your characters class is the most importantfactor in bringing your concept into the game. Yourcharacters class is sort of like their job. Each class covers adifferent set of capabilities and responsibilities.\n\nYour character class gives you class features at 1st level asdescribed in each class features table (see Character Classeslater in this chapter) and lists other features you gain accessto as your character gains adventuring experience andlevels up. Your choice of character class also dictates yourproficiencies, which is a game term describing what kindsof equipment you are trained to use (like armor, weapons,or tools) and what kinds of challenges you are best athandling (skills and saves).\n\nChoosing your character class can also help you makeother decisions. For example, each class has a Quick Buildsection that tells you which ability scores (described in Step3) work best with your class abilities.\n\nSee the Class Options at a Glance table later in thischapter for a brief summary and comparison of each class.\n<PAGE>\nSTEP 3. DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES\n\nAt their core, characters are defined by six abilities:\n\nâ€¢ Strength (STR), representing your physical might.\n\nâ€¢ Dexterity (DEX), representing your agility and\n\nreaction time.\n\nâ€¢ Constitution (CON), representing your endurance\n\nand physical fortitude.\n\nâ€¢ Intelligence (INT), representing your ability to\n\nacquire and apply knowledge.\n\nâ€¢ Wisdom (WIS), representing your intuition and\n\nmental fortitude.\n\nâ€¢ Charisma (CHA), representing your self-confidence\n\nand your ability to influence others.\n\nEach ability is assigned a number, called an ability score.These scores represent your various physical and mentalabilities. Higher numbers in a score mean you character isbetter with that ability.\n\nAs you level up, you can increase these scores, but a PCcan never have an ability score higher than 20. An averageperson has 10 in every ability score, so these numbersemphasize how powerful adventurers are!\n\nTHREE WAYS TO SCORE\n\nThere are three methods to determine your starting abilityscores. No method is better than another, but somepeople like one way more, so we include them to appeal todifferent kinds of players.\n\nMETHOD ONE: ROLLING\n\nThis is the classic, providing surprises and maybe a toughchoice. It helps make a character you adapt to, instead ofyou making all the decisions:\n\nâ€¢ Roll four d6s. Find the lowest die and throw it out.Then add up the remaining three dice to get your total.Write that number down on scratch paper.\n\nâ€¢ Do this five more times until you have six totalsbetween 3 and I8.\n\nâ€¢ Assign those six numbers to the ability scores howeveryou like.\n\nâ€¢ Finally, add 2 to one score of your choice that is 16 orbelow and add 1 to one score of your choice that is 17or below.\n\nMETHOD TWO: POINT-BUYIf you dont want to leave it up to chance, you can assignability scores with the point-buy method:â€¢ Start with 32 points to spend on your ability scores.â€¢ Each score costs a certain number of points. Find thecost of each potential score on the Point-Buy Costtable. (As an example, a score of 12 costs 4 points.)\n\nâ€¢ 18 isthe highest ability score you can start with, and youcant have a score lower than 8.\n\nâ€¢ Buy one score for each of the six abilities.\n\nâ€¢ Dont add anything extra when youre done here. Thesenumbers are already balanced without adding more.\n\nPOINT-BUY COST\n\nSCORE COST SCORE COST SCORE COST8 0 12 4 16 1\n\n9 1 13 5 17 13\n\n10 2 14 7 18 16\n\n11 3 15 9\n\nMETHOD THREE: STANDARD ARRAY\n\nTo get started faster, use the standard array. Start with sixnumbers: 16, 14, 14, 13, 10, and 8. Assign them as abilityscores however you want. Again, dont modify them anyfurther. Thats it!\n\nFIND ABILITY MODIFIERS\n\nOnce you assign scores, use the following charts to figureout your ability modifiers. Your ability modifiers are themost important part of your ability scores. You use yourmodifiers much more than your score to calculate successor failure in the game.\n\nABILITY MODIFIERS\n\nABILITY ABILITY\n\nSCORE MODIFIER SCORE MODIFIER1 5 12-13 +1\n\n2-3 -4 14-15 +2\n\n4-5 3 16-17 +3\n\n6-7 -2 18-19 +4\n\n8-9 -1 20 $5\n\n10-11 +0\n\nPC Wisdom: When you see an ability referencedin the rules, assume it means the ability scoremodifier (-1, 0, +1, +2, etc.) rather than the abilityscore itself (8, 10, 12, 14, etc.). For example, if afeature reads .. . roll and add your STR, thatmeans add your Strength ability modifier, not yourfull Strength ability score.\n\n\n<PAGE>\noLcrLArNe\n<PAGE>\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nChapter 1: Character Creation .........cscssc......ssess...s 3 Magic Items .......s......cesecesess...cesec...s...ceneeneecaseneens 57Step-by-Step Character Creation........sc...ses......e 3 Using a Magic Item... ... es...sec...c.........eaeenes 57Character Classes .........scce...ssescssec...cseescesecesecneesneenes 6 Magic Item Descriptions..........sseeseeses.........es 58\n\nCOLIC. ...ececescesessceecseseeseceescesse......ese...sese...eseesaesFighter i Chapter 4: Spellcasting..........csccsesec...se......s...ees 61Rogue 14 What is a Spell? ccc cssc...eeseeseescrseesees 61Wizard 6 Circles Of Magic ........sesesccesseseesceseceseesees...neeaeesees 61LIMea ge... ceeccccccssce...cessescssesce...ssessee...ee...ee......s 18 Spell Rings vseessesevrorsserversseserevnsneesereenersserensecee 62Heritage ....ccceccecce...eesseessescsee...ee...ee...sesseseas...s 20 Spell SlOts ....se...esr...rsserssvrsnsosseesevren...sserevnsnsessees 62Backgrounds.........eesseceseceseesseecesec...esseeceseen...aseneens 23 Elements of A Spell .sesse......rsessessensseseeverssers...ene 63Talents... eesseecesec...ssceec...c...sscesees...esesees...eeseenees 25 Spell Lasts ....so...se...ese...sserseven...sessersven......eserenane 65Luck 28 Spell Descriptions..........c...sesecesec...sseeces......neeneens 67Ritual Descriptions... ees...sec...s...ces......neeneens 88\n\nChapter 2: Playing the Game...........scc...eseseesees 29 Additional Spell Descriptions..........seec......s......ee 93Rolling the Dice... ee see...secesec...es...cesec...enseneens 29AAVeENtULING oe. ee ... es...eess...ec...seesa...ec......eaeaeenee 34 Chapter 5: Monsters ..sr......sescesrer...s...sseceennnns...see 96Combat 38 Optional Rule: Doom ....... ee ...sc...s...eesec...eseeneens 96\n\nHow to Use These Monster .........cccccsesse...sseec...s...s 96\n\nChapter 3: Equipment & Magic Items............000 47 Elements of a Stat BOCK... 0. es ...eec...sees.........sees 96\n\nEquipMent .o...ccccccccsscsc...cssesce...see...sessese...sees...s 47 Monsters Ato Zuccccccccccssc...sescssec...e...se...sse......s 103ALIMOL ....ccceccssccccessessesccecececessess...eeccceesesesaeses...sees 47 Animals .....cccccccccesse...eccecccese...eccecccese......sececesessees 130WEAPONS wo cceeccceccecseteesetesste...eecsse...eseese......s...s 49 NPCS... . ccc cccc...sscceecccccccee...cecccc...e...ec...c...saaaesesces 132Adventuring Gear and Tools........csscec...s...s......s 52 . .\n\nMounts and Vehicles ............cccceccsscsse......sesec...s...s 56 Appendix: Conditions .v...sse...sse......e 137Food, Drink, and Lodging 0... se eseeses...eer...ees 56SELVICES .....ccccce...ssccceececcesseessesccccc...ens...ceec...aueaeenes 57\n\nORC NOTICE: This product is licensed under the ORC License, located at the Library of Congress at TX 9-307-067, andavailable online at various locations including www.azoralaw.com/orclicense and others.All warranties are disclaimed as set forth therein.\n\nAttribution: This work includes material taken from the System Reference Document 5.1 (SRD 5.1) by Wizards of theCoast LLC and available at https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document.\n\nThe SRD 5.1 is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.\n\nIf you use our Licensed Material in your own published works, please credit us as follows:Black Flag Roleplaying Reference Document vo.1, @ Open Design, LLC d/b/a Kobold Press\n\nReserved Material: Reserved Material elements in this product include all elements designated as Reserved Material underthe ORC License.\n\nExpressly Designated Licensed Material: This product contains no Expressly Designated Licensed Material.\n<PAGE>\nCHAPTER 1: CHARACTER CREATION\n\nThe first step to play is creating your player character (PC).\n\nCharacter creation involves making rules choices thatdefine who your character is and what your character isgood at, as well as creative choices about your charactershistory and personality.\n\nThis chapter contains exact steps and options to createyour character. If you are creating a character for the firsttime, it can be helpful to work with your game master\n\n(GM) to choose options that make a good play experience.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEPCHARACTER CREATION\n\nThese are the steps needed to create your character.\n\nSTEP 0. GATHER MATERIALS\n\nMake sure these basic tools are handy to record yourcharacter choices:\n\nâ€¢ pencil\n\nâ€¢ blank character sheet\n\nâ€¢ scratch paper\n\nâ€¢ dice (see About Those Dice in the sidebar)\n\nABOUT THOSE DICE\n\nThe Black Flag Roleplaying system uses polyhedraldice to resolve actions. These dice are abbreviatedin game text, so a four-sided die is a d4, a six-sideddie is a d6, and so on for d8, d10, d12, and d20.Percentile dice rolls (1-100) are rolled with two diceand abbreviated d%.\n\nSTEP 1. CREATE A CHARACTER CONCEPT\n\nIt can help to think about what kind of character you wantto play before you start picking from lists. Do you want\n\nto cast magic spells? Do you want to be good at swinging\n\na sword? Do you want to play as a human or a member ofsome more fantastical lineage? Knowing what sounds likefun to you can help guide your decisions.\n\nTalk to the other players about your ideas if theyrearound. Hearing what other players have in mind canhelp focus your choices or inspire you to create a conceptthat works well with other adventurers in your party.\n\nFor example, if all the other PCs are rough-and-tumblewarriors, you might want to make a cleric so you can patchthem up with healing magic!\n\nSTEP 2. CHOOSE A CLASS\n\nChoosing your characters class is the most importantfactor in bringing your concept into the game. Yourcharacters class is sort of like their job. Each class covers adifferent set of capabilities and responsibilities.\n\nYour character class gives you class features at 1st level asdescribed in each class features table (see Character Classeslater in this chapter) and lists other features you gain accessto as your character gains adventuring experience andlevels up. Your choice of character class also dictates yourproficiencies, which is a game term describing what kindsof equipment you are trained to use (like armor, weapons,or tools) and what kinds of challenges you are best athandling (skills and saves).\n\nChoosing your character class can also help you makeother decisions. For example, each class has a Quick Buildsection that tells you which ability scores (described in Step3) work best with your class abilities.\n\nSee the Class Options at a Glance table later in thischapter for a brief summary and comparison of each class.\n<PAGE>\nSTEP 3.

For example, if afeature reads .. . roll and add your STR, thatmeans add your Strength ability modifier, not yourfull Strength ability score.\n\n\n<PAGE>\nSTEP 4. CHOOSE A LINEAGE\n\nChoose your characters lineage from the options in theLineage section later in this chapter. Lineage tells youabout certain hereditary traits such as average lifespan,size, speed, and any special adaptations like the ability tosee in the dark.\n\nLineage represents the blood ties and hereditary traits of acreature. Adventurers can be humans or a common fantasylineage, like dwarf or elf.\n\nSTEP 5. CHOOSE A HERITAGE\n\nChoose your characters heritage from the options in theHeritage section later in this chapter. Heritage tells youabout traits your character has because of their connectionto a particular group or society.\n\nHeritage represents the upbringing and culture ofacharacter. Adventurers can come from nearly any kind offantasy society, such as a big city, a forest enclave, or anunderground citadel.\n\nSTEP 6. CHOOSE A BACKGROUND\n\nChoose your characters background from the options inthe Backgrounds section later in this chapter. Backgroundsgive you skill proficiencies, talents, and languages learned.Backgrounds represent what your character did asan individual before they took up the adventuring life.Adventurers are often a motley group and come from awide variety of backgrounds. Backgrounds include optionslike adherent or scholar.\n\nSTEP 7. FILL IN THE BLANKS\n\nAt this point, your big decisions are locked in. You stillneed to equip your character (see Chapter 3) and pick spellsif theyre a spellcaster (see Chapter 4). But youve got thebasics squared away.\n\nTake some time to look things over and fill in any blanksections on your character sheet (see Final Checklist below).Make sure to give your character a name and decide what\n\nthey look like. Its also a good idea to think about yourcharacters history and personalitybut its perfectly fineto decide these details later. You might discover more aboutwho you want your character to be after playing for a coupleof game sessions.\n<PAGE>\nCHARACTER CLASSES\n\nEvery adventurer has a character class that dictates theheroic features they have access to. It can be helpful tothink ofa characters class like their job, with each typecovering a different set of capabilities and responsibilities.\n\nThe Class Options at a Glance table gives an overviewabout the classes detailed in this section.\n\nELEMENTS OF A CLASS\n\nThis section breaks down the various components of acharacter class.\n\nPROGRESSION TABLE\n\nThe Progression table for your class tells you what classfeatures you get at Ist level and what new features you gainas you level up.\n\nAFTER LEVEL 1\n\nCharacters start at 1st level and can advance up to 20thlevel by gaining experience points (XP) during theiradventures. By default, PCs start with o XP.\n\nWhen your PC gains a new level, you gain access to the\n\nbenefits listed in the Progression table for the class at the\n\nnew level. You also gain 1 hit die and more hit points.\n\nTo calculate these new hit points, roll the new hit die,add your CON modifier to the roll, and add the totalto your total hit points. If you dont want to roll, youcan use the average hit die value (listed in each classdescription) plus your CON modifier.\n\nLEVELING METHODS\n\nThe GM keeps players aware of progress toward the nextlevel by awarding XP or by tracking milestones. The GM\n\ndecides which method to use.\n\nTRACKING XPWhen a GM tracks XP, they tally up the challenges thatthe PCs overcame during the session and award XP for\n\nLEVEL\n\nCharacters start at 1st level and can advance up to 20thlevel. See the After Level 1 sidebar for more on this.\n\nPROFICIENCY BONUSProficiency bonus (PB) represents the benefit of training.As your character advances in levels, their training leads toimproved performance at things they are proficient in.Every class advances at the same rate, but we put theprogression in each class Progression table for convenience.Whenever you make a check that involves a skill, tool,or save you have proficiency in, add your PB to that roll.Occasionally, a feature might allow you to double yourPB on certain rolls, but doubled or not, apply your PB toaparticular roll only once.Checks and the role of PB when making checks isexplained in greater detail in Chapter 2.\n\nthem at the end. This method is good for groups thatbattle lots of monsters and have clearly defined areas ofchallenge. The Level Advancement table details the XPyou need to advance to new levels. Dont reset the XPtotal after each level, just keep piling it on.\n\nTRACKING MILESTONES\n\nWhen the GM tracks milestones, PCs level up whenthey achieve a specific goal established by the GM. Themilestone method works well for looser, faster pacedgames or player groups that focus on storytelling, asopposed to tactical combat or dungeon delving.\n\nAs a general rule, 1st-level PCs should hit a level-upmilestone after a single game session. Then, 2nd-levelPCs should hit a milestone after two game sessions,and 3rd-level PCs should hit a milestone after threegame sessions. They should hit another milestoneapproximately every three sessions after that. A GMcan use dramatic license to speed up or slow downmilestone advancement.\n\nLEVEL ADVANCEMENTLEVEL XP LEVEL XP LEVEL XP LEVEL XP1 0 6 14,000 11 85,000 16 195,0002 300 7 23,000 12 100,000 17 225,0003 900 8 34,000 13 120,000 18 265,0004 2,700 9 48,000 14 140,000 19 305,0005 6,500 10 64,000 15 165,000 20 355,000\n<PAGE>\nHIT POINTS AND HIT DICE\n\nSTARTING EQUIPMENT\n\nYour class determines the size of your hit dice (HD), whichyou use to calculate your hit points (HP).\n\nYouwr hit point total represents your characters lifeforce. Classes with bigger hit dicelike a dtoare morelikely to survive a few hits in combat than a class withsmaller hit dicelike a d6.\n\nAt ist level, your character starts with a hit point totalequal to the highest number on their hit die, plus theirCON modifier. So, a tst-level fighter (dro hit die) with aCON +3 starts with a hit point total of 13.\n\nPROFICIENCIES\n\nProficiencies describe what kinds of equipment you aretrained to use, like armor, weapons, and tools. They alsodescribe what kind of challenges you are best at handling,represented by skills and saves.\n\nCLASS OPTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nDESCRIPTION HIT DIE\n\nKEY ABILITY\n\nEach character class includes a list of starting equipment. Ifyou are creating a Ist-level character, you get this equipmentalong with any equipment granted by your background.\n\nFEATURE DESCRIPTIONS\n\nEach class includes descriptions of each of the featureslisted in the class Progression table.\n\nSUBCLASSES\n\nEach class has access to a specialization of some kindfurther study or training in a particular subject. Thesespecializations are called subclasses. At the end of the classfeatures section, youll find some subclass options.\n\nSAVE PROFICIENCIES\n\nEQUIPMENT PROFICIENCIES\n\nFaithful casters who wield\n\nLight and medium armor, shields,\n\nCleric . d8 Wis WIS & CHA :divine magic simple weapons.

You choose more divine circle cantrips to learn athigher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column ofthe Cleric Progression table.\n\nCLERIC PROGRESSION\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells\n\nYou must prepare a spell in advance before you can cast it.Clerics may prepare any spell from the divine circle spelllist that they have slots for. (Check the Cleric Progressiontable to see which rings you have slots for at your level.)\n\nTo prepare spells, choose a number of spells from thedivine circle spell list equal to your WIS modifier + yourcleric level (minimum of one spell). These prepared spellsare the pool of options from which you can cast.\n\nTo cast a prepared spell, you must use a slot of the spellsring or higher. You regain all used spell slots when youfinish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if youre a 3rd-level cleric, you have four Ist-ring and two 2nd-ring spell slots. With a 16 WIS, your listof prepared spells can include six spells of Ist or 2nd ring,in any combination. Casting the spell doesnt remove itfrom your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when youfinish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requirestime spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute perspell ring for each spell you change.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability. You use your WISwhenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Inaddition, use your WIS modifier when setting the saveDC fora spell you cast and when making an attack rollwith a spell.\n\nSpell save DC =8 + your PB + your WIS modifierSpell attack modifier = your PB + your WIS modifier\n\nRitual Casting\n\nAs a cleric, you can also cast a long-form type of spell calleda ritual. You do not need to prepare ritual spells, and theydo not use up spell slots.\n\nAt 1st level, choose one ritual from the divine circle rituallist. You choose more divine rituals to learn at higherlevels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the ClericProgression table. You can only learn a ritual spell from aring you have spell slots for. Rituals you learn do not countagainst the number of spells you learn at each level.\n\nCANTRIPS RITUALSLEVEL PB FEATURES KNOWN KNOWN 1ST RING 2ND RING 3RD RINGIst +2 Spellcasting, Manifestation of Faith 3 1 2 _ _2nd +2 Channel Divinity (1/rest) 3 1 3 _ _3rd +2 Cleric Subclass 3 2 4 2 _Ath +2 Improvement 4 2 4 3 =5th +3 Destroy the Profane (CR 2) 4 3 4 3 2\n<PAGE>\nSpellcasting FocusYou can use a holy symbol (see Adventuring Gear and Toolsin Chapter 3) as a spellcasting focus for your spells.\n\nMANIFESTATION OF FAITHist-Level Cleric FeatureAll clerics, regardless of deity, demonstrate their faith inone of two primary wayswielding it as a holy warrior orcalling it forth as a worker of miracles. Choose one of thefollowing ways your faith most readily manifests:Manifest Might. You gain proficiency with heavy armorand martial weapons. Additionally, you gain the ability toinfuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once oneach of your turns when you hit a creature with a weaponattack, you can cause the attack to deal additional radiantor necrotic damage (your choice) equal to your PB.Manifest Miracles. You learn one additional cantrip ofyour choice from any circle of magic. This cantrip countsas a divine cantrip for you, but it doesnt count against thenumber of cantrips you know. Additionally, you can addyour PB to the damage you deal with any divine cantrip.\n\nCHANNEL DIVINITY\n\n2nd-Level Cleric Feature\n\nYou gain the ability to channel divine energy directly fromyou deity, which you use to power effects beyond spells.You start with one such effect: Turn the Profane. Somedomains grant you additional effects as you advance inlevels, as noted in the domain description (see ClericSubclasses below).\n\nWhen you use Channel Divinity, choose an effect tocreate. You must then finish a short or long rest to use yourChannel Divinity again.\n\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saves. When youuse such an effect from this class, the DC equals your clericspell save DC.\n\nChannel Divinity: Turn the Profane\n\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak aprayer censuring unholy creatures. Each Fiend and Undeadof your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of\n\nyou must make a WIS save. If the creature fails its save, it isturned for I minute or until it takes any damage.\n\nA turned creature must try to move as far away from youas it can, and it cant willingly move to a space within 30feet of you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action ortry to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.If theres nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodgeaction. It cant take any reactions.\n\nCLERIC SUBCLASS\n\n3rd-Level Cleric Feature\n\nChoose one domain related to your deity, such as Life orWar (see Cleric Subclasses below). Your choice grants youdomain spells and other features at 3rd level.\n\nDomain SpellsEach subclass has a list of spellsits domain spellsthatyou gain access to as soon as you can cast spells of that ring(as shown in the Cleric Progression table). Once you gaina domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesntcount against the number of spells you can prepare eachday.

Luck cantoffset effects of a natural 1 or create a natural 20.\n<PAGE>\nCHAPTER 2: PLAYING THE GAME\n\nThis chapter details how the game works, breaking downthe mechanical rules and elements necessary for play.\n\nROLLING THE DICE\n\nMost of what happens during Black Flag game play can\n\nbe handled through conversations between the playercharacters (PCs) and the Game Master (GM). But whenevera PC attempts something remarkable, where there is thepotential to fail, its time to roll the dice. Your charactersability modifiers and proficiencies can increase yourchances of success, along with other factors covered here.\n\nThis section describes how dice rolls are used todetermine success or failure. It outlines the stages ofmaking a roll and how a roll may be affected by charactercapabilities or external circumstances.\n\nMAKING CHECKS\n\nMost dice rolls in the Black Flag Roleplaying game arechecks. All checks involve rolling a 20-sided die called ad2o.\n\nTo make a check, roll a d20 to determine your startingnumber. Then add one of the ability modifiers on yourcharacter sheet. Finally, ifyou are proficient in somethingrelevant to the roll, add your proficiency bonus (PB). Thetotal of those numbers is your check result.\n\nCheck FormulaCheck Result = d20 + Ability Modifier + PB (If you have arelevant proficiency)\n\nSTAGES OF A CHECK\n\nâ€¢ Player describes the task they want to accomplish.\n\nâ€¢ GM decides if a check is needed. If not, play continues.Ifa check is needed, proceed to next step.\n\nâ€¢ GM declares what kind of check is needed, includingwhich ability modifier it uses and what proficienciesare relevant.\n\nGM determines if the check is being made withadvantage or disadvantage.\n\nPlayer rolls a d20 (or two d20s if they have advantage ordisadvantage).\n\nPlayer adds their ability modifier and PB (if they have arelevant proficiency) to the number rolled to determinetheir check result.\n\nIf desired, a PC spends Luck points to increase thecheck result.\n\nGM compares the check result to the check DC anddeclares whether the check succeeds or fails.\n\nABILITY MODIFIERS\n\nAll checks in the game are tied to one of the six abilitymodifiersStrength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution(CON), Wisdom (WIS), Intelligence (INT), or Charisma(CHA). You add one of these six ability modifiers to everycheck. The rules typically dictate which modifier you mustuse for a particular check, but in cases where no ability islisted, the GM decides which one is relevant.\n\nFor more information about applying ability modifiers tochecks, see the Which Ability Modifier? sidebar.\n\nPROFICIENCY BONUS\n\nAll PCs have a proficiency bonus determined by their level.Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated intheir stat blocks.\n\nOnly add your PB to a die roll or DC once. For example, iftwo different rules allow you to add your PB toa WIS save,you may add it only once.\n\nOccasionally, you might double or halve your PB beforeyou add it. If some circumstance suggests that your PBapplies more than once to the same roll, you still add it onlyonce and double or halve it only once.\n\nIf your PB doesnt apply to a roll, doubling doesnt changethat. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the Historyskill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you doubleyour PB when you make INT (History) checks.\n<PAGE>\nIn general, dont double your PB for attack rolls or saves.If some feature or effect allows you to do so, the above rulesstill apply.\n\nDETERMINING SUCCESS OR FAILURE\n\nIn most cases, you measure your check result against atarget number the GM sets for you, called a difficulty class(DC). If your check result is equal to or higher than theDC, your roll succeeds! If its less than the DC, you fail.\n\nDETERMINING DC\n\nMost of the time, the rules tell the GM what a DC shouldbe. For example, a PC must get a check result of 19 orhigher to successfully attack a creature with an AC 19 (ACis one example ofa pre-determined DC).\n\nWhen the rules dont provide a DC, the GM gets to set anappropriate number. If youre the GM and you arent sure,think about how hard you want a task to be. Then consultthe Typical Difficulty Class table to assign a number. Youcan always set it at a number that isnt divisible by 5.\n\nTYPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASS\n\nHigh Chance of Success 10 or lessModerate Chance of Success 15\n\nLow Chance of Success 20\n\nAlmost No Chance of Success 25 or higher\n\nADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE\n\nSometimes special circumstances allow you to roll acheck with advantage or force you to roll a check withdisadvantage.\n\nRolling with advantage means you roll two d2os, thenuse the higher of the two numbers to calculate your checkresult.\n\nRolling with disadvantage means you roll two d2os,then use the lower of the two numbers to calculate yourcheck result.\n\nFor example, if you have advantage and rolla17 anda 5,you use the 17. If you instead have disadvantage, use the 5.\n\nIf two or more favorable situations grant advantage,you still roll only one additional dao. Same goes fordisadvantage. You only ever roll a maximum of two d20s.\n\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage anddisadvantage, they cancel each other out, and you roll onlyone d2o. This works no matter how many circumstancesimpose disadvantage or grant advantage. If they conflict atall, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\n\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and a rule letsyou reroll the d2o0, you can reroll only one of the dice. Youchoose which one. For example, if you have advantage ordisadvantage on an ability check and roll a1 anda 13, youcould reroll the 1 or the 13, but not both.\n\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through theuse of special abilities, actions, or spells. You can also useLuck points to grant advantage. Finally, the GM can decidethat circumstances influence a roll in one direction or theother and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as asituational call.\n\nLUCK\n\nEvery PC has a special resource called Luck. Use Luck toinfluence the result of any ability check, attack roll, or saveyou make.\n\nSPENDING LUCK POINTS\n\nSpend Luck points on a 1-for-1 bonus to add to any d2oroll you make. For example, if you have 4 Luck points,and rolla 13 on the die, you could spend 2 Luck pointsand make your result a 15. You then have 2 Luck points touse later. You cant use Luck points to offset the effects ofrolling a natural 1 or create the effects of a natural 20. Noone is that lucky.\n\nAlternatively, immediately after you make an abilitycheck, attack roll, or save, you can spend 3 Luck points toreroll a single d2o used for that roll.\n\nGAINING LUCK POINTS\n\nWhen you create your character, you start with o Luckpoints. You gain Luck points in the following ways:\n\nâ€¢ Once per turn, when you fail an attack roll or save, gain1 Luck point.\n\nâ€¢ The GM can award 1 Luck point to a character asareward for coming up with a clever idea, excellentroleplaying, or trying something interesting but notoptimal.\n\nâ€¢ The GM can award Luck points to a party for survivingdifficult encounters or achieving story goals (inaddition to XP).\n\nLOSING LUCK POINTS\n\nAPC may have a maximum of 5 Luck points at one time. Ifyour PC has 5 Luck points and would gain a sixth, you mustimmediately roll a d4 and reset your Luck points to the die\n\nresult.\n<PAGE>\nTHE THREE TYPES OF CHECKS\n\nBlack Flag rules have three types of checks. All use thesame core mechanics described in the Making Checkssection, but each is used in different circumstances andhas different rules around whether you add your PB tothe check result. Each type of check is described in greaterdetail here.\n\nATTACK ROLLS\n\nAttack rolls are checks used almost exclusively duringcombat for attacking. For a full rundown on attack rolls,refer to the Combat section later in this chapter.\n\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIESIf you have proficiency with the weapon youre using(simple or martial), add your PB to the attack roll.\n\nSAVES\n\nSaves are checks made to resist or avoid threats from spells,traps, poisons, diseases, or similar hazards. You dontnormally decide to make a save; the GM asks you to makeone because your character is at risk of harm.\n\nTo makea save, roll a d2o and add the appropriate abilitymodifier. For instance, use your DEX modifier for a DEXsave.\n\nThe DC for a save is determined by the effect that calls forit. As an example, when you make a save against a spell,the DC is determined by the casters spellcasting abilityand PB.\n\nThe result of a successful or failed save is described in theeffect after its DC.\n\nA successful save usually means that a creature suffers noharm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\n\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\n\nYour character class gives you proficiency in at least twosaves based on which ability modifiers are useful for theclass. The wizard, for example, is proficient in INT andWIS saves. Add your PB to saves according to your class.\n\nABILITY CHECKS\n\nWhen you want to do something that isnt covered by anattack roll or save, make an ability check. Since abilitychecks cover a wide range of tasks, they are slightly morecomplex than the other two types of checks.\n\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add theappropriate ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, applybonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC.If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check isa success. You overcome the challenge. Otherwise, itsa failure. You make no progress toward the objective,or you make some progress but also suffer a setback, asdetermined by the GM.\n\nCONTESTS\n\nSometimes your efforts are directly opposed by someoneelse. This can occur when multiple creatures try to do thesame thing but only one can succeed, such as snatching amagic ring falling to the floor. It can also occur when onecreature tries to prevent another one from accomplishinga goalfor example, a monster might try to force open\n\na door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situationslike these, the outcome is determined by a special form ofability check, called a contest.\n\nEvery participant in a contest makes an ability check.Apply appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead ofcomparing the total toa DC, compare the check results.The participant with the highest check result wins thecontest and either succeeds at the action or prevents otherparticipants from succeeding.\n\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains thesame. Thus, one participant might win by default. If twocreatures tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor,neither character grabs it. Ina contest between a monstertrying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep itclosed, a tie means that the door stays shut.\n\nPASSIVE CHECKSA passive check doesnt involve any die rolls. This kind ofability check can represent an average result for a task donerepeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and overagain. Ora GM can use it to secretly determine whether aPC succeeds at something the player doesnt know to try todo, such as noticing a hidden monster.\n\nA passive check total is called a score. Heres how todetermine a characters passive score:\n\nâ€¢ 10+all modifiers that normally apply to the check.\n\nâ€¢ Ifthe character has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage,subtract 5.\n\nSo, for example, if a 1st-level character has a WIS +2ability modifier and is proficient in the Perception skill,they have a passive Perception score of 14 (10 + 2 for WIS +2 for PB).\n\nWORKING TOGETHER\n\nSometimes two or more creatures team up ona job. Thecreature with the highest ability modifier is designated thelead for the effort. That creature can make an ability checkwith advantage, reflecting the help given by the others. Incombat, this requires the Help action.\n\nAcreature can only provide help if they have capacity todo the task. For example, trying to open a lock requiresproficiency with thieves tools, so a character who lacksthat proficiency cant work together on a lock-picking job.Moreover, a character can help only when their assistancewould be productive. Threading a needle doesnt get anyeasier with another pair of hands.\n<PAGE>\nGROUP CHECKS\n\nWhen a number of individuals try to accomplish somethingas a group, the GM might ask for a group check. In thiscase, characters who are skilled at a particular task helpcover those who arent.\n\nTo make a group check, everyone in the group makes theability check. If at least half the members succeed (roundup), the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.\n\nGroup checks dont come up often, and theyre mostuseful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group.For example, when adventurers navigate a swamp, theGM might call for a WIS (Survival) group check to seeif the whole party can avoid quicksand, sinkholes, andother hazards of the environment. If at least half thegroup succeeds, the successful characters can guide theircompanions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumblesinto a hazard.\n\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIESTwo main types of proficiencies can modify an ability check.\n\nTool Proficiencies\n\nA tool helps you do something you couldnt otherwise do,such as repair an item, forge a document, or picka lock.Your background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents cangive you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with\n\na tool allows you to add your PB to any ability check youmake using that tool.\n\nTool use is not tied to a single ability modifier. Thecheck depends on what youre trying to do, at the GMsdiscretion. For example, when using woodcarvers tools,the GM might ask you to make a DEX check to carveout fine detail or a STR check to make something out ofparticularly hard wood.\n\nSkill Proficiencies\n\nEvery PC starts the game with skill proficiencies grantedby their background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents.Proficiency in a skill means you can add your PB to abilitychecks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in a skill,you dont add your PB to ability checks.\n\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb a dangerouscliff, the GM might ask for a STR (Athletics) check. If thecharacter is proficient in Athletics, the player rolls a d2o,adds their characters STR modifier and then adds PB. Ifthe character lacks that proficiency, the player rolls ad2oand adds only their characters STR modifier.\n\nThe rules in a scenario usually prompt a GM to ask for anability check using a specific skillfor example, Make aWIS (Perception) check. Sometimes though, more thanone skill might reasonably apply to a situation. A player canask the GM if a different skill is relevant to the check. If theGM agrees, the PC can try a skill theyre more proficient in!\n\nSKILL DESCRIPTIONS\n\nThe skill descriptions here explain the different ways youcan use the skill.\n\nACROBATICS\n\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX)\n\nYour DEX (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stayon your feet in a tricky situation, such as running across asheet of ice, balancing on a tightrope, or staying uprightona rocking ships deck.

You might deduce the location of a hidden object,discern from a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, ordetermine the weakest point in a tunnel that could causeitto collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of ahidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an INT(Investigation) check.\n\nMEDICINE\n\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)\n\nAWIS (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dyingcompanion or diagnose an illness.\n\nNATURE\n\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)\n\nYour INT (Nature) check measures your ability to recalllore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, andnatural cycles.\n\nPERCEPTION\n\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)\n\nYour WIS (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, orotherwise detect the presence of something.

Until you are discovered or stop hiding, that checkresult is contested by the Perception score of a creaturewho might discover you.\n\nYou cant attempt to hide from a creature that can senseyou clearly, and you give away your position if you makenoise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over avase.\n\nA creature with the invisible condition (see Appendix)can always attempt to hide and has advantage on DEX(Stealth) checks to do so.\n\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs ofdanger, so if you come out of hiding and approach acreature, it typically senses you. However, under certaincircumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hiddenas you approach a distracted creature, granting youadvantage on an attack roll (see Unseen Attackers andTargets in the Combat section of this chapter).\n\nPerception Score. In a monster or NPC stat block, eachcreature has a Perception score. Whether a monsteris actively searching for you or just going about theirbusiness, the GM compares your DEX (Stealth) checkresult to the creatures Perception score to see whetherthey notice you.\n\nWhat Can You See? A big factor in determiningwhether you can find something is how well you can see.Visibility in an area could be lightly or heavily obscured(see Vision and Light in the Adventuring section of thischapter).\n\nADVENTURING\n\nThis section covers the various rules that come withexploring the world and some important ways PCs interactwith the environment.\n\nTIME\n\nWhen the passage of time matters, the GM determineshow longa task takes. Talking about the passage of timedepends on what characters are trying to do and wheretheyre trying to do it.\n\nIn combat and other fast-paced situations, the gamerelies on rounds, a 6-second span of time in which everyparticpant gets a turn.\n\nIn a dungeon environment, outside of combat, movementmore often happens on a scale of minutes. It might takea minute to creep down a long hallway, another minuteto check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, anda good Io minutes to search the chamber beyond foranything interesting or valuable.\n\nIna city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often moreappropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely towerat the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles injust under four hours time.\n\nFor long journeys, a scale of days works best. Followingthe road between cities, the adventurers spend fouruneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts theirjourney.\n\nAGM should always feel free to shift between these scalesto match whats happening in the game and to keep thingsmoving at the table.\n\nMOVEMENT AND TRAVEL\n\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeoncorridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slopeall sorts ofmovement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.The GM can summarize movement without calculatingexact distances or travel times: You travel through theforest and find the dungeon entrance late in the eveningof the third day. Even in a dungeon, particularly a largedungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarizemovement between encounters: After killing the guardianat the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, youconsult your map, which leads you through miles of echoingcorridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.Sometimes though, its important to know how long ittakes to get from one spot to another, whether the answeris in days, hours, or minutes. Rules for determining traveltime depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace ofthe creatures moving and the terrain theyre moving over.\n<PAGE>\nSPEED\n\nDIFFICULT TERRAIN\n\nEvery creature has a speed, the distance in feet that thecharacter or monster can walk in 1 round. This numberassumes short bursts of energetic movement in a life-threatening situation.\n\nWhen the situation is less dire, the following rulesdetermine how far a character or monster can move inaminute, an hour, or a day.\n\nTRAVEL PACE\n\nWhile traveling, a party can move at a fast, normal, orslow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The tablestates how far they can move in a period of time for theirpace, and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pacemakes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makesit possible to sneak around and to search an area morecarefully.\n\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes thatcharacters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push beyondthat limit at the risk of exhaustion.\n\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, thecharacters cover the distance shown in the Hour columnfor their pace, and each character must make a CON save atthe end of the hour.\n\nThe DC is 10 +1 for each hour past 8 hours. Ona failedsave, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (seeAppendix).\n\nMounts and Vebicles. For short spans of time (up to anhour), many animals move much faster than humanoids.A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour,covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If freshmounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters cancover larger distances at this pace, but this is rare except indensely populated areas.\n\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicleschoose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vesselare limited to the speed of the vessel, and they dont sufferpenalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace.Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, shipsmight be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\n\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, orspecial vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travelmore swiftly.\n\nTRAVEL PACE\n\nDISTANCE TRAVELED PER...\n\nPACE MINUTE HOUR DAY\n\nEFFECT\n\nFast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles -9 penalty toPerception scoreNormal 300 feet 3 miles 24 miles _. . Able to useSlow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles Stealth\n\nThe travel speeds given on the Travel Pace table assumerelatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or cleardungeon corridors. However, adventurers often face denseforests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains,and ice-covered groundall considered difficult terrain.You move at half speed in difficult terrain moving I footin difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speedso you can coveronly half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nSPECIAL TYPES OF MOVEMENT\n\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wildernessareas often involves more than walking. Adventurers mighthave to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they needto go.\n\nCLIMBING, SWIMMING, AND CRAWLING\n\nWhile climbing or swimming, each foot of movementcosts I extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) unless acreature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GMsoption, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with fewhandholds requires a successful STR (Athletics) check.Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water mightrequire a successful STR (Athletics) check.\n\nJUMPING\n\nYour STR determines how far you can jump.\n\nLong Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover anumber of feet up to half your walking speed if you moveat least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. Whenyou make a standing long jump, you can leap only a quarterof your walking speed. Either way, each foot you clear onthe jump costs a foot of movement.\n\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesntmatter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At theGMs option, you must succeed on a DC 10 STR (Athletics)check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of thejumps distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise,you hit it.\n\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed ona DC 10 DEX (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet.Otherwise, you land prone.\n\nHigh Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap intothe air a number of feet equal to 3 + your STR modifier ifyou move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before thejump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jumponly half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear onthe jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances,your GM might allow you to make a STR (Athletics) checkto jump higher than you normally can.\n\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourselfduring the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distanceequal to the height of the jump plus 11/2 times your height.\n<PAGE>\nFALLING\n\nA fall from a great height is acommon hazard for anadventurer. At the end ofa fall, a creature lands prone andtakes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every Io feet it feltoa maximum of 20d6unless it has a feature or ability thatallows it to avoid taking damage from the fall.\n\nSUFFOCATING\n\nAcreature can hold its breath for a number of minutesequal to 1 + its CON modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\n\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it cansurvive for a number of rounds equal to its CON modifier(minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it dropsto o hit points and is dying, and it cant regain hit points orbe stabilized until it can breathe again.\n\nFor example, a creature with a CON modifier of +2 canhold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2rounds to reach air before it drops to o hit points.\n\nVISION AND LIGHT\n\nThe fundamental tasks of adventuringnoticing danger,finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, andtargeting a spell, to name just a fewrely heavily onacharacters ability to see.\n\nDarkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove asignificant hindrance.\n\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. Inalightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, ormoderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on WIS(Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n\nA heavily obscured areasuch as darkness, opaquefog, or dense foliageblocks vision entirely. A creatureeffectively suffers from the blinded condition (seeAppendix) when trying to see something in that area.\n\nThe presence or absence of light in an environmentcreates three categories of illumination: bright light, dimlight, and darkness.\n\nBright light lets most creatures see normally. Evengloomy days can provide bright light, as do torches,lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within aspecific radius.\n\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscuredarea. An area of dim light is usually a boundary betweena source of bright light, such as a torch, and surroundingdarkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also countsas dim light. A brilliant full moon might bathe the land indim light.\n\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters facedarkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights),within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area ofmagical darkness.\n\nDARKVISION\n\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially thosethat dwell underground, have darkvision.\n\nWithin a specified range, a creature with darkvision cansee in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areasof darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creatureis concerned. However, the creature cant discern color indarkness, only shades of gray.\n\nKEENSENSE\n\nA creature with keensense can perceive its surroundingswithout relying on sight within a specific radius.Creatures without eyes, such as Oozes, and creatures withecholocation or heightened senses, such as bats and truedragons, have this sense.\n\nTRUESIGHT\n\nAcreature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see innormal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures andobjects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeedon saves against them, and perceive the true form of acreature with the shapechanger tag or a creature that istransformed by magic.\n\nFurthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\n\nFOOD AND WATER\n\nCharacters who dont eat or drink suffer the effects ofexhaustion (see Appendix). Exhaustion caused by lack offood or water cant be removed until the character eats anddrinks the full required amount.\n\nFOOD\n\nAcharacter needs one pound of food per day. You can makefood last longer by eating half rations. Eating half rationsina day counts as half a day without food.\n\nA character can go without food for a number of daysequal to 3 + CON modifier (minimum 1). Beyond that, acharacter automatically suffers one level of exhaustion atthe end of each day.\n\nOne normal day of eating resets the count of days withoutfood to zero.\n\nWATER\n\nAcharacter needs one gallon of water per day or twogallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinksonly half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 CONsave or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.Acharacter with access to even less water automaticallysuffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.\n\nIf the character already has at least one level ofexhaustion, the character suffers two levels each day withlittle or no water.\n<PAGE>\nINTERACTING WITH OBJECTS\n\nAcharacters interaction with objects in an environment isoften simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GMthat their character is doing something, such as moving alever, and the GM describes whatif anythinghappens.\n\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever,which might raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood withwater, or open a secret door in a nearby wall.\n\nIf the lever is rusted in position though, a character mightneed to force it. In sucha situation, the GM might call fora STR check to see whether the character can wrench thelever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such checkbased on the difficulty of the task (see Determining DCearlier in this chapter).\n\nCharacters can also damage objects with weaponsand spells. Objects are immune to poison damage, butotherwise they can be affected by physical and magicalattacks much like creatures can. The GM determines anobjects AC and HP and might decide that certain objectshave resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacksits hard to cut a rope with a club, for example. Objectsalways fail STR and DEX saves, and they are immune toeffects that require other saves. When an object drops to ohit points, it breaks.\n\nAcharacter can also attempt a STR check to break anobject. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\n\nSTATISTICS FOR OBJECTS\n\nGiven enough time, its safe to assume that a PC can (andwill) destroy most breakable objects. In these cases, theGM decides what a PC can reasonably accomplish. Forexample, it is reasonable to say a fighter can never cutthrough a stone wall with a sword but can chop a candle inhalf in the time it takes to talk about it.\n\nHowever, when time is a factorlike cutting through theropes of a bridge before a horde of angry goblins chargesacrossgiving objects some statistics helps everyoneunderstand whats achievable. In these situations, use thefollowing rules to determine an objects armor class andhit points.\n\nArmor Class. An objects AC is a measure of how difficultit is to deal damage to the object by striking it. The objectcant dodge, but its AC represents its material resilience.The Object Armor Class table provides suggested ACvalues for various substances.\n\nOBJECT ARMOR CLASSSUBSTANCE AC SUBSTANCE ACCloth, paper, rope 11 Iron, steel 19Crystal, glass, ice 13 Mithral 21Wood, bone 15 Adamantine 23Stone 17\n\nINTERACTING WITH OBJECTS AROUND YOU\n\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of things you cando during your move or your action:Draw or sheathe a sword\n\n* Open or close a door\n\n* Get a potion from your backpack\n\n* Pick up a dropped weapon\n\n* Take a bauble from a table\n\nRemove a ring from your finger\n\n* Stuff some food into your mouthPlant a banner in the ground\n\nFish a few coins from your belt pouch* Drink all the ale in a flagon\n\n* Throw a lever or a switch\n\nPull a torch from a sconce Extinguish a small flame\n\nDona mask\n\nPull the hood of your cloak up and over your headPut your ear to a door\n\n* Kick a small stone\n\nâ€¢ Turn a key ina lock\n\n* Tap the floor with a 10-foot pole\n\nHand an item to another character\n\nHit Points. An objects hit points measure how muchdamage it can take before losing structural integrity.Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones.Whether an object is fragile or resilient is up to the GM.Large objects tend to have more hit points than smallones, unless breaking any small part of it breaks the wholething. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hitpoint amounts for fragile and resilient objects that areLarge or smaller.\n\nOBJECT HIT POINTS\n\nSIZE FRAGILE RESILIENTTiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4)Small (chest, lute) 3 (1d6) 10 (3d6)Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8)Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window) 5 (1d10) 27 (5d10)\n\nHuge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are oflittle use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, suchasa colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massiveboulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, andan earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You cantrack a Huge or Gargantuan objects hit points if you like,though it might be simpler to decide how long the objectcan withstand whatever force is acting against it and track\n<PAGE>\nthat. If you do track hit points for the object, divide it intoLarge or smaller sections, and track each section separately.Destroying a smaller section could ruin the entire object. Forexample, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple overwhen one of its Large legs is reduced to o HP.\n\nObjects and Damage Types. Objects are immune to poisondamage. You might decide some damage types are more orless effective against a particular object or substance. Forexample, bludgeoning damage works well for smashingthings but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper orcloth objects might be vulnerable to fire. As always, use goodjudgment and let the GM make the call.\n\nDamage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls oftenhave extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. Anobject with a damage threshold ignores any single attack thatdeals damage less than its damage threshold. For example, ifa wall has a damage threshold of 10, attacks that deal 9 or lessdamage to it deal no damage at all.\n\nRESTING\n\nHeroic though they might be, adventurers need resttimeto sleep, eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds andspirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for furtheradventure.\n\nAdventurers can take short rests during an adventuring dayand a long rest to end the day.\n\nSHORT REST\n\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long,\n\nduring which a character does nothing more strenuous thaneating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\n\nYou can spend one or more hit dice at the end of a shortrest, up to your maximum number of hit dice (which is equalto your characters level). For each hit die spent in this way,roll the die and add your characters CON modifier to it. Thecharacter regains hit points equal to the total. You can decideto spend an additional hit die after each roll. You regain somespent hit dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.\n\nLONG REST\n\nAlong rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours\n\nlong, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity:reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuousactivityat least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, orsimilar adventuring activitythe character must begin the restagain to gain any benefit from it.\n\nAt the end ofa long rest, you regain all lost hit points.You also regain spent hit dice, up to half of your maximum(minimum of 1). For example, if your character has 8 hit dice,you regain 4 of them upon finishing a long rest.\n\nAcharacter cant benefit from more than one long rest ina24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit pointat the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\n\nCOMBAT\n\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides,\n\na flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, andspellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combatinto a cycle of rounds and turns. A round representsabout 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, eachparticipant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns isdetermined at the beginning of a combat encounter, whenall participantsPCs and monsters alikeroll initiative.Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to thenext round if neither side has defeated the other.\n\nSURPRISE\n\nA band of adventurers quietly sneaks up on a bandit camp,springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous\n\ncube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by theadventurers until it engulfs one of them. In these situations,one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\n\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neitherside tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice eachother. Otherwise, the GM compares the DEX (Stealth)checks of anyone hiding with the Perception score of eachcreature on the opposing side. Any character or monsterthat doesnt notice a threat has the surprised condition atthe start of the encounter.\n\nIf youre surprised, you cant move or take an action onyour first turn of the combat, and you cant take a reactionuntil that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprisedeven if the other members arent.\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat.When combat starts, every participant makes a DEX checkto determine their place in the initiative order. The GMmakes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, soeach member of the group acts at the same time.\n\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one withthe highest DEX check result to the one with the lowest.This is called initiative order, and the GM follows it todetermine when each participant acts during each round.Initiative order remains the same from round to round.\n\nIfa tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tiedGM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the orderamong their tied characters. The GM can decide the orderif the tie is between a monster and a player character.Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters andmonsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highestroll going first.\n<PAGE>\nYOUR TURN\n\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speedand take one action. You decide whether to move first ortake your action first. Your speed sometimes called yourwalking speedis noted on your character sheet.\n\nThe most common actions you can take are described inthe Actions in Combat section in this chapter. Many classfeatures and other abilities provide additional options foryour action.\n\nThe Movement and Position section in this chapter givesmore detailed rules for your move.\n\nYou dont have to move, take an action, or do anythingat allon your turn. If you cant decide what to do on yourturn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, asdescribed in Actions in Combat.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\n\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you takean additional action on your turn called a bonus action.The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue totake a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only whena class feature, spell, or other special ability states that youcan do something as a bonus action. Otherwise, you donthave a bonus action to take.\n\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so youmust choose which bonus action to use when you havemore than one available.\n\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn,unless the bonus actions timing is specified. Anything thatdeprives you of your ability to take an action also preventsyou from taking a bonus action.\n\nREACTIONS\n\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow youto take a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to\n\na trigger, which can occur on your turn or on someoneelses. The opportunity attack is the most common type ofreaction.\n\nWhen you take a reaction, you cant take another oneuntil the start of your next turn. If the reaction interruptsanother creatures turn, that creature can continue its turnright after the reaction.\n\nOTHER ACTIVITY ON YOUR TURN\n\nYour turn can include a variety of minor flourishes thatdont require your action or your move. Some pointers:\n\nâ€¢ You can communicate at any time through brief talkingand gestures.\n\nâ€¢ You can interact with one object or feature of theenvironment for free, during either your move or youraction. For example, you could open a door during yourmove, or you could draw your weapon as part of yourAttack action.\n\nâ€¢ Ifyou want to interact with a second object, you need tocommit your action to it.\n\nâ€¢ Some magic items and other special objects alwaysrequire an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\n\nThe GM might require you to use an action for anyof these activities when it needs special care or when itpresents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM couldreasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck dooror turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\n\nMOVEMENT AND POSITION\n\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constantmotion, often using movement and position to gain theupper hand.\n\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed.You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like onyour turn, following the rules here.\n\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, andswimming. These different modes of movement can becombined with walking, or they can be your entire move.However you move, deduct the distance of each part ofyour move from your speed until it is used up or until youare done moving.\n\nBREAKING UP YOUR MOVE\n\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using somespeed before and then the remainder after your action. Forexample, ifyou have a speed of 30 feet, you can move Iofeet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\n\nCOMBAT STEP BY STEP\n\n1. Determine surprise. The GM determines whether anyoneinvolved in the combat encounter is surprised.\n\n2. Establish positions. The GM decides where all the PCsand monsters are located. Given the adventurers marchingorder or their stated positions in the room or other location,the GM figures out where the adversaries arehow faraway and in what direction.\n\n3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounterrolls initiative, determining the order of combatants turns.\n\n4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn ininitiative order.\n\n5. Begin the next round. After everyone involved in thecombat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 untilthe fighting stops.\n\n\n<PAGE>\nMOVING BETWEEN ATTACKS\n\nIf your action involves more than one weapon attack, youcan break up your movement even further by movingbetween attacks. For example, a fighter who can make twoattacks with the Multiattack feature and has a speed of 25feet could move Io feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, andthen attack a different target.\n\nUSING DIFFERENT SPEEDS\n\nIf you have more than one speed, such as a walking speedand a flying speed, you can switch back and forth betweenthem during your move. Whenever you switch, subtractthe distance youve already moved from the new speed. Theresult determines how much farther you can move. If theresult is 0 or less, you cant use the new speed during thecurrent move.\n\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speedof 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you couldfly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet. If you wanted to walk anyfarther, youd be done for your move, but you could stillleap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\n\nDIFFICULT TERRAIN\n\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featurelessplains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests,treacherous staircasesthe setting of a typical fightcontains difficult terrain.\n\nEvery foot of movement in difficult terrain costs I extrafoot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a spacecount as difficult terrain.\n\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow,and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. Thespace of another creature, whether hostile or not, alsocounts as difficult terrain.\n\nBEING PRONE\n\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground,either because they are knocked down or because theythrow themselves down. In the game, they are prone, acondition described in the Appendix.\n\nYou can drop prone freely, without using any speed.Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amountof movement equal to half your speed.\n\nFor example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend I5feet of movement to stand up. You cant stand up if youdont have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\n\nTo move while prone, you must crawl or use magic suchas teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawlingcosts I extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain,therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\n\nMOVING AROUND OTHER CREATURES\n\nYou can move through a nonhostile creatures space. Youcan only move through a hostile creatures space if thecreature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you.Remember that another creatures space is difficult terrainfor you.\n\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you cantwillingly end your move in its space.\n\nIf you leave a hostile creatures reach during your move,you provoke an opportunity attack.\n\nFLYING MOVEMENT\n\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits, but they must\n\nalso deal with the danger of falling. Ifa flying creature isknocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwisedeprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless\n\nit has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic,such as by the fly spell.\n\nCREATURE SIZE\n\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. TheSize Categories table shows how much space a creature of aparticular size controls in combat.\n\nObjects sometimes use the same size categories.\n\nSIZE CATEGORIES\n\nTiny 2% by 2% ft.\n\nSmall 5 by 5 ft.\n\nMedium 5 by 5 ft.\n\nLarge 10 by 10 ft.\n\nHuge 15 by 15 ft.Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger\n\nSPACE\n\nA space is the area in feet that a creature effectively controlsin combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions.Atypical Medium creature isnt 5 feet wide, for example,but ina fight, it controls that space. Ifa Medium hobgoblinstands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures cant getthrough unless the hobgoblin lets them.\n\nAcreatures space also reflects the area it needs to fighteffectively. For that reason, theres a limit to the number ofcreatures that can surround another creature in combat.Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit ina5-foot radius around another one.\n\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer ofthem can surround a creature. If five Large creaturescrowd around a Medium or smaller one, theres little roomfor anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Mediumcreatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\n<PAGE>\nSQUEEZING INTO A SMALLER SPACE\n\nDODGE\n\nAcreature can squeeze through a space that is large enoughfor a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Largecreature can squeeze through a passage thats only 5 feetwide. While squeezing through a space, a creature mustspend I extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it hasdisadvantage on attack rolls and DEX saves. Attack rollsagainst the creature have advantage while its squeezing.\n\nACTIONS IN COMBAT\n\nWhen you take your action on your turn, you can take oneof the actions presented here, an action gained from yourclass or a special feature, or an action that you improvise.Many monsters have their own distinct actions in theirstat blocks.\n\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere inthe rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possibleand what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determinesuccess or failure.\n\nATTACK\n\nThe most common action in combat is the Attack action,whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from abow, or brawling with your fists.\n\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack.See the Making an Attack section later in this chapter forrules that govern attacks.\n\nCertain features, such as the fighters Multiattack, allowyou to make more than one attack with this action.\n\nCAST A SPELL\n\nSpellcasting characters, such as clerics and wizards, andsome monsters can take the Cast a Spell action to cast aspell in combat. You can only cast spells this way if the spellhas a casting time of I action. Ifa spells casting time islonger than an action (minutes or hours) or a reaction, youcant take this action to cast it.\n\nDASH\n\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movementfor the current turn. The increase equals your speed,\n\nafter applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, forexample, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if youdash.\n\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes thisadditional movement by the same amount. If your speed of30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move upto 30 feet this turn with a Dash.\n\nDISENGAGE\n\nWhen you take the Disengage action, your movementdoesnt provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.\n\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely onavoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, youmake DEX saves with advantage and attack rolls madeagainst you have disadvantage if you can see the attacker.You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explainedin the Appendix) or ifyour speed drops to 0.\n\nHELP\n\nWhen you take the Help action, you lend aid to anothercreature to complete a task. That creature gains advantageon the next ability check it makes to perform the task youare helping with, provided that it makes the check beforethe start of your next turn.\n\nYou can also take the Help action to aid a friendly creatureattack a target within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract thetarget, or otherwise team up to make your allys attackmore effective. If your ally attacks the target before yournext turn, they get advantage on their first attack roll.\n\nHIDE\n\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a DEX (Stealth)check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding.If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in theUnseen Attackers and Targets section in this chapter.\n\nREADY\n\nWhen you take the Ready action, you prepare to dosomething on another creatures turn using your reaction.This lets you get the jump on a foe or wait for a particularcircumstance before you act. You must take your readiedreaction before the start of your next turn.\n\nFirst, name a perceivable circumstance that triggers yourreaction. Then, state the action or move you will take inresponse to that trigger. Examples include, If the cultiststeps on the trapdoor, Ill pull the lever that opens it, andTf the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\n\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reactionright after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\n\nYou can ready a spell with the Ready action. You cast itas normal but hold its energy. Then, after the trigger, yourelease it with your reaction.\n\nTo be readied, a spell must have a casting time of I action,and holding the energy requires concentration. If yourconcentration is broken, the spell dissipates withouttaking effect. For example, if you are concentrating onthe web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends.Furthermore, if you take damage before you release thereadied magic missile, your concentration might be broken.\n<PAGE>\nSEARCH\n\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote yourattention to finding something. Depending on the natureof your search, the GM might have you make a WIS(Perception) check or an INT (Investigation) check.\n\nUSE AN OBJECT\n\nWhen you take the Use an Object action, you focusspecifically on that interaction. Since you can normallyinteract with an object while doing something else, such asdrawing a sword as part of an attack, this action is usuallyonly needed when you want to interact with more than oneobject on your turn. If an object is complex or requires anability check to use, the GM might require this action evenif its the only object youve handled this turn.\n\nMAKING AN ATTACK\n\nWhether youre striking with a melee weapon, firing aweapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell,an attack has a simple structure.\n\n1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attacksrange: a creature, an object, ora location.\n\n2. Determine modifiers. The GM determines whetherthe target has cover and whether you have advantageor disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells,special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties orbonuses to your attack roll.\n\n3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. Ona hit,you roll damage unless the particular attack has rulesthat specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effectsin addition to or instead of damage.\n\nIf theres ever any question whether something youredoing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if youremaking an attack roll, youwre making an attack.\n\nATTACK ROLLS\n\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determineswhether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll,rolla d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the checkresult equals or exceeds the targets AC, the attack hits.(The AC for an NPC or monster is in its stat block.)\n\nMODIFIERS TO THE ROLLWhen a PC makes an attack roll, the two most commonmodifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and thecharacters PB. When a monster makes an attack roll, ituses the modifier provided for the action in its stat block.Ability Modifier. The ability modifier for a melee weaponattack is STR, and the ability modifier for a ranged weaponattack is DEX. Weapons with the finesse or thrownproperty break this rule; see weapon property descriptionsin chapter 3 for more on that.Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability\n\nmodifier used fora spell attack depends on the spellcastingability of the spellcaster.\n\nProficiency Bonus. Add your proficiency bonus to yourattack roll when you attack using a weapon with which youhave proficiency and any time you attack with a spell.\n\nROLLING 1 OR 20\n\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing thenovice to hit and the veteran to miss.\n\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hitsregardless of any modifiers or the targets AC. This is calleda critical hit. See Critical Hits later in the chapter for moreon this.\n\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack missesregardless of any modifiers or the targets AC.\n\nUNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS\n\nCombatants can try to escape notice by hiding, casting theinvisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.\n\nWhen you attack a target you cant see, you havedisadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether youreguessing at the targets location or targeting a creature youcan hear but not see. If the target isnt in the location youtargeted, you automatically miss, though the GM mightjust say that you missed, not whether you guessed thetargets location correctly.\n\nWhen a creature cant see you, you have advantage onattack rolls against it. If you are hiddenboth unseen andunheardwhen you make an attack, you give away yourlocation when the attack hits or misses.\n\nCOVER\n\nWalls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can providecover during combat, making a target more difficult toharm. A target benefits from cover only when an attack orother effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\n\nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behindmultiple sources of cover, only the most protective coverapplies. For example, if a target is behind a creature thatgives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarterscover, the target has three-quarters cover.\n\nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and DEXsaves. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at leasthalf of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a largepiece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, ora creature,whether that creature is an enemy ora friend.\n\nA target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to ACand DEX saves. A target has three-quarters cover if aboutthree-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstaclemight be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\n\nA target with total cover cant be targeted directly by anattack ora spell, although some spells can reach a targetwith total cover by including it in an area of effect. A targethas total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.\n<PAGE>\nRANGED ATTACKS\n\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow oracrossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles tostrike at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from itstail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.\n\nRANGE\n\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within aspecified range.\n\nIf a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, hasasingle range, you cant attack a target beyond this range.\n\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbowora shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is thenormal range, and the larger number is the long range.Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target isbeyond normal range, and you cant attack a target beyondthe long range.\n\nRANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT\n\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is nextto you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, aspell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on theattack roll ifyou are within 5 feet of a hostile creature whocan see you and who isnt incapacitated.\n\nMELEE ATTACKS\n\nA melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach.A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such asasword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makesa melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth,tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involvemaking a melee attack.\n\nMost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attacktargets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack.Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium)have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as notedin their descriptions.\n\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack,you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt,or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons).On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damageequal to 1 + your STR modifier. You are proficient withyour unarmed strikes.\n\nOPPORTUNITY ATTACKS\n\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chanceto strike an enemy who flees or passes by. Such a strike iscalled an opportunity attack.\n\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostilecreature that you can see moves out of your reach. To makethe opportunity attack, use your reaction to make onemelee attack against the provoking creature. The attackoccurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\n\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack bytaking the Disengage action. You also dont provoke anopportunity attack when you teleport or when someoneor something moves you without using your movement,action, or reaction. For example, you dont provoke anopportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foesreach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\n\nTWO-WEAPON FIGHTING\n\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a lightmelee weapon held in one hand, you can use a bonusaction to attack with a different light melee weapon youhold in the other hand. You dont add your ability modifierto the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier isnegative.\n\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throwthe weapon instead of making a melee attack with it.\n\nGRAPPLING\n\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special meleeattack to grapple a creature. If you can make multipleattacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one ofthem.\n\nThe target must be no more than one size larger thanyou and must be within your reach. Using at least one freehand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple checkinstead of an attack roll: a STR (Athletics) check contestedby the targets STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check(the target chooses which check to use). If you win thecontest, you subject the target to the grappled condition(see Appendix). The condition specifies what ends it, andyou can release the target whenever you like (no actionrequired).\n\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use itsaction to escape. It must succeed on a STR (Athletics) orDEX (Acrobatics) check contested by your STR (Athletics)check.\n\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you candrag or carry the grappled creature with you, but yourspeed is halved unless the creature is two or more sizessmaller than you.\n\nSHOVING\n\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special meleeattack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or pushit away from you. If you can make multiple attacks with theAttack action, this attack replaces one of them.\n\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than youand must be within your reach. Instead of making an attackroll, you make a STR (Athletics) check contested by thetargets STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (thetarget chooses which check to use). If you win the contest,you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet awayfrom you.\n<PAGE>\nDAMAGE AND HEALING\n\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions ofthose who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of asword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireballspell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, thehardiest of creatures.\n\nHIT POINTS\n\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mentaldurability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with morehit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hitpoints are more fragile.\n\nAcreatures current hit points (usually just called hitpoints) can be any number from its hit point maximumdown to o. This number changes frequently as a creaturetakes damage or receives healing.\n\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage issubtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has noeffect on a creatures capabilities until the creature drops too hit points.\n\nTEMPORARY HIT POINTS\n\nSome spells and special abilities give you temporary hitpoints. Dont add these to your current hit points. Instead,think of them as a buffer against damage, a pool of hitpoints that protects you from injury.\n\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage,lose the temporary hit points first. Any leftover damagecarries over to your current hit points. For example, if youhave 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose thetemporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\n\nBecause temporary hit points are separate fromyour current hit points, they can exceed your hit pointmaximum. You can be at full hit points and receivetemporary hit points.\n\nHealing cant restore temporary hit points, and youcant stack temporary hit points together. If you havea pool of temporary hit points and then get more fromanother source, decide whether to keep the ones you haveor take the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12temporary hit points when you already have 10, you canhave I2 or Io, not 22.\n\nIf you have o hit points, receiving temporary hit pointsdoesnt restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.\n\nThey can still absorb damage directed at you while youreunconscious, but only true healing can stabilize you.\n\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points hasa duration, they last until depleted or you finish a long rest.\n\nDAMAGE ROLLS\n\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifiesthe damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, addany modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magicweapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant\n\na bonus to damage. A penalty might cause you to deal odamage, but you never deal negative damage.\n\nWhen attacking with a weapon, add your abilitymodifierthe same modifier used for the attack rolltothe damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damageand whether to add any modifiers.\n\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to more than onetarget at the same time, roll damage once for all of them.For example, when a wizard casts fireball, the player rollsdamage once for all creatures caught in the blast.\n\nCRITICAL HITS\n\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dicefor the attacks damage against the target. Roll all of theattacks damage dice twice and add them together. Thenadd any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, youcan roll all damage dice at once.\n\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger,roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then addyour relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves otherdamage dice, such as from the rogues Sneak Attack feature,roll those dice twice as well.\n\nDAMAGE TYPES\n\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmfuleffects deal different types of damage. Damage types haveno rules of their own, but other rules, such as damageresistance, rely on the types.\n\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GMassign a damage type to a new effect.\n\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragons breath andthe dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding dealacid damage.\n\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attackshammers, falling,constriction, and the likedeal bludgeoning damage.\n\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devils spearand the frigid blast of a white dragons breath deal colddamage.\n\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjureflames to deal fire damage.\n\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into adamaging form. Most effects that deal force damage arespells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\n\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragons breathdeal lightning damage.\n\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain Undead andaspell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\n\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, includingspears and monsters bites, deal piercing damage.\n\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a greendragons breath deal poison damage.\n\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a psionic blast dealpsychic damage.\n<PAGE>\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a clerics flame strikespell or an angels smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fireand overloads the spirit with power.\n\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters claws deal slashingdamage.\n\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effectof the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\n\nDAMAGE RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY\n\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult orunusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\n\nIfa creature or an object has resistance to a damage type,damage of that type is halved against it. Ifa creature or anobject has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of thattype is doubled against it.\n\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after allother modifiers to damage. For example, a creature hasresistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attackthat deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is alsowithin a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so thecreature takes 10 damage.\n\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability thataffect the same damage type count as only one instance.For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage aswell as resistance to nonmagical damage, the damage of anonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, notreduced by three-quarters.\n\nHEALING\n\nUnless it results in death, damage isnt permanent. Restcan restore a creatures hit points, and magical methodssuch as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can removedamage in an instant.\n\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit pointsregained are added to its current hit points. A creatureshit points cant exceed its hit point maximum, so anyhit points regained in excess of this number are lost. Forexample, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing.If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit pointmaximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points, not 8.\n\nAcreature that dies cant regain hit points until magicsuch as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\n\nDROPPING TO 0 HIT POINTS\n\nWhen you drop to o hit points, you either die outright orfall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\n\nINSTANT DEATH\n\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damagereduces you to o hit points and there is damage remaining,you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hitpoint maximum.\n\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit pointscurrently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage froman attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, and 12 damageremains. Because the remaining damage equals her hitpoint maximum, the cleric dies.\n\nFALLING UNCONSCIOUS\n\nIf damage reduces you to o hit points and fails to kill you,you fall unconscious (see Appendix). This unconsciousnessends if you regain any hit points.\n\nDEATH SAVES\n\nWhenever you start your turn with o hit points, you mustmake a special save, called a death save, to determinewhether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlikeother saves, this one isnt tied to any ability score. You arein the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and featuresthat improve your chances of succeeding on a save.\n\nRoll a d2o. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed.Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effectby itself. On your third success, you become stable (seebelow). On your third failure, you die.\n\nSuccesses and failures dont need to be consecutive; keeptrack of both until you collect three of a kind. The numberof both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points orbecome stable.\n\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death save and roll a1on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on thed2o, you regain 1 hit point.\n\nDamage at o Hit Points. If you take any damage whileyou have o hit points, you suffer a death save failure. Ifthe damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failuresinstead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit pointmaximum, you suffer instant death.\n\nSTABILIZING A CREATURE\n\nThe best way to help a creature with 0 hit points is to healit. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least bestabilized so that it isnt killed by a failed death save.\n\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to anunconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it withasuccessful DC 10 WIS (Medicine) check.\n\nA stable creature doesnt make death saves, even thoughit has o hit points, but it does remain unconscious. Thecreature stops being stable, and must start making deathsaves again if it takes any damage. A stable creature thatisnt healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\n\nMONSTERS AND DEATHMonsters generally die the instant they drop to 0 hitpoints, since tracking death saves for a dozen monsters canbe tedious.\n\nMighty villains and special NPCs are commonexceptions, though. The GM can decide to have them fallunconscious and follow the same rules as PCs.\n<PAGE>\nKNOCKING A CREATURE OUT\n\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe ratherthan deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces acreature to o hit points with a melee attack, the attackercan choose to knock the creature out instead of killing it.The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage isdealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\n\nMOUNTED COMBAT\n\nAwilling creature that is at least one size larger than youand that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount,granting you use of their speed and mobility.\n\nMOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING\n\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature thatis within 5 feet of you, or you can dismount. This costsan amount of movement equal to half your speed. Forexample, ifyour speed is 30 feet, you must spend Is feetof movement to mount a horse. You cant mount it if youdont have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.\n\nIf an effect moves your mount against its will while youreon it, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or fall off themount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If youreknocked prone while mounted, you must make the samesave with the same results.\n\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reactionto dismount and land on your feet as it falls. Otherwise,you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feetof it.\n\nCONTROLLING A MOUNT\n\nWhile youre mounted, you have two options. You caneither control the mount or allow it to act independently.Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, generally prefer toact independently.\n\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained toaccept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similarcreatures are assumed to have such training. The initiativeof acontrolled mount changes to match yours when youmount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only threeaction options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlledmount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\n\nAn independent mount retains its place in the initiativeorder. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actionsthe mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. Itmight flee from combat, rush to devour a downed foe, orotherwise act against your wishes.\n\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attackwhile youre on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.\n\nUNDERWATER COMBAT\n\nWhen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their underseahomes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or findthemselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in achallenging environment. Underwater, the following rulesapply.\n\nWhen making a melee weapon attack, a creature thatdoesnt have a swimming speed (either natural or grantedby magic) has disadvantage on attack rolls unless theweapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\n\nA ranged weapon attack cant hit a target beyond itsnormal range. The attack roll has disadvantage even withinnormal range unless the weapon is a crossbow, net, or aweapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear,trident, or dart).\n\nCreatures and objects that are fully immersed in waterhave resistance to fire damage.\n<PAGE>\nCHAPTER 3: EQUIPMENT & MAGIC ITEMS\n\nThis chapter lists the equipment available to PCs andexplains additional rules on the topic. It also contains a fewmagic items PCs might find during their adventures.\n\nCURRENCY\n\nCoins used in the game are minted in precious metalsgenerally considered valuable by most cultures. Thisstandardization of value is widely accepted, even bycommunities that wouldnt traditionally value such things.\n\nThe four most common coins are the copper piece (cp),the silver piece (sp), the gold piece (gp), and the platinumpiece (pp). Average coins weigh less than half an ounce. Apouch of 50 coins weighs 1 pound.\n\nCURRENCY CONVERSION\n\nCOIN cP sP GP PPCopper (cp) 1 WM0 1/100 1/1,000Silver (sp) 10 1 10 1/100Gold (gp) 100 10 1 110Platinum (pp) 1,000 100 10 1\n\nSELLING NONMAGICAL ITEMS\n\nMost nonmagical equipment can be resold for half itsoriginal value, assuming it is in good shape. Equipmentretrieved from the corpses of monsters is rarely in resalecondition.\n\nNonmagical treasures like cut gemstones, works of art, orfine jewelry can generally be resold at full price.\n\nFor rules on buying and selling magic items, see the MagicItems section later in this chapter.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nThis section covers the standard nonmagical equipmentavailable and the rules concerning their use.\n\nARMOR\n\nWearing armor increases your armor class (AC), which\n\nin turn increases your chance of avoiding enemy attacks.When an enemy attempts an attack, their attack roll totalmust meet or beat your AC to deal damage. So, the higheryour AC, the greater the chance of avoiding damage!\n\nThe Armor table lists the cost, AC bonus, weight, specialproperties, and proficiencies required to successfully usethe various kinds of armor.\n\nARMOR TYPES & PROFICIENCIES\n\nEach armor is categorized into a type that is associatedwith a proficiency. For instance, a character withproficiency in light armor can wear any of the kinds ofarmor listed in the light armor section of the armor tablewithout penalty.\n\nYour character can wear any kind of armor, but if youdont have proficiency, you have disadvantage on all STRand DEX ability checks made while wearing it. It is alsoimpossible to cast spells while wearing armor you arentproficient with.\n\nLIGHT ARMOR\n\nLight armor provides minimal protection while stillallowing its wearer to move with relative ease. Its flexibilitymakes it the go-to choice for rogues and other DEX-basedcharacter builds.\n\nMEDIUM ARMOR\n\nMedium armor provides more protection than light armor,but it uses bulkier materials that interfere with range ofmotion. The additional protection offered by mediumarmor makes it a popular choice for clerics who need to\n\nbe close enough to the danger to aid their allies, but dontneed to move quickly around the battlefield.\n<PAGE>\nHEAVY ARMOR\n\nHeavy armor provides the most protection of any armortype, but wearing it demands great physical prowess.Fighters are one of the few character classes that can takefull advantage of heavy armors defensive capabilities.\n\nSHIELDS\n\nShields are a unique type of armor because they are heldinstead of worn. This means you can lose their AC bonusif the shield is destroyed or dropped. Wielding a shieldrequires the use of one hand, which means a PC cant usetwo-handed weapons while holding a shield. You can onlybenefit from one shield AC bonus at a time, even whileholding multiple shields.\n\nARMOR PROPERTIES\n\nCertain sets of armor have properties that affect how theyare used, as shown in the Properties column of the Armortable.\n\nCumbersome. This armor is heavy and difficult to move inunless you possess the required STR. Ifa player characterdoes not have a STR score equal to or greater than theSTRscore listed in parentheses, their movement speed isreduced by io feet while they wear the armor, even if theyare proficient with it.\n\nNatural Materials. This armor does not interfere with adruids ability to cast spells. At GMs discretion, a shieldcan have this property.\n\nNoisy. This armor imposes disadvantage on any abilitychecks made to avoid notice, like sneaking, hiding, orotherwise attempting to move silently.\n\nGETTING INTO AND OUT OF ARMOR\n\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on thearmors category.\n\nDon. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefitfrom the armors AC only if you take the full time to donthe suit of armor.\n\nDoff. This is the time it takes to remove armor. If you havehelp, reduce this time by half.\n\nDONNING AND DOFFING ARMOR\n\nCATEGORY DON DOFFLight Armor 1 minute 1 minuteMedium Armor 5 minutes 1 minuteHeavy Armor 10 minutes 5 minutesShield 1 action 1 action\n\nPC Wisdom: Casting spells with somatic componentsrequires at least one free hand. Unless you have afeature that allows you to work around this (such\n\nas the Combat Caster talent), your spellcastingcapabilities suffer while you hold both a weapon anda shield.\n\nARMORARMOR COST AC BONUS WEIGHT PROPERTIESLight ArmorLeather 10 gp 1 + DEX modifier 10 Ib.

The table is also split by proficienciesrequired (simple and martial) to successfully wield thevarious weapons.\n\nWEAPON TYPES & PROFICIENCIES\n\nEach weapon is categorized into a type associated with aproficiency. For instance, a character with proficiency inmartial weapons gets to add their PB to attack rolls madewith any weapon listed in the martial weapons section ofthe Weapons table.\n\nAny character can wield any weapon, but only a characterwith proficiency can add their PB to attack rolls with thoseweapons.\n\nMELEE WEAPONSMelee weapons are used to attack nearby targets (typicallywithin 5 feet).\n\nRANGED WEAPONSRanged weapons are used to attack targets at a distance.\n\nSIMPLE WEAPONS\n\nSimple weapons require little experience to use effectively.These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weaponsoften found in the hands of commoners.\n\nMARTIAL WEAPONS\n\nMartial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms,require more specialized training to use effectively. Mostwarriors use martial weapons because these weapons tendto deal more damage and put their training to best use.\n\nIMPROVISED WEAPONS\n\nSometimes characters dont have their favorite weaponsand must fight with whatevers handy.

You can use a weapon that has theammunition property to make a ranged attack only if youhave ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each timeyou attack with the weapon, you expend one piece ofammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver,case, or other container is part of the attack (you needa free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the endof an encounter, you can recover half your expendedammunition by taking 1 minute to search the battlefield.\n\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property tomake a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvisedweapon (see Improvised Weapons sidebar). A sling must beloaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\n\nFinesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon,use your choice of your STRor DEX modifier for theattack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifierfor both rolls.\n\nHeavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rollswith heavy weapons.

The first is theweapons normal range in feet, and the second indicatesthe weapons long range. When attacking a target beyondnormal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. Youcant attack a target beyond the weapons long range.\n\nReach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when youattack with it, as well as when determining your reach foropportunity attacks with it.\n\nThrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you canthrow it to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a meleeweapon, use the same ability modifier for that attack rolland damage roll that you would use for a melee attack withthe weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, use yourSTR, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your STRor your DEX, since the dagger has the finesse property.\n\nTwo-Handed. This weapon requires you to use two handswhen you attack with it.\n\nVersatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands.These weapons have two damage values listed. The higherdamage value is used when you use two hands to make amelee attack.\n<PAGE>\nADVENTURING GEAR AND TOOLS\n\nEquipment that is useful for adventurers, but isnt armor orweapons, is called adventuring gear.

Most such hirelingshave fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of\n\na craft or art, and a few are experts with specializedadventuring skills.\n\nSome basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table.Other common hirelings include any of the wide varietyof people who inhabit a typical town or city and whom theadventurers pay to perform a specific task. For example,\n\na wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaboratechest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chestspell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge aspecial sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisiteclothing for an upcoming performance for the duke.\n\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerousservices. Mercenary soldiers paid to help take onahobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired toresearch ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurerestablishes a stronghold of some kind, they might hire awhole staff of servants and agents to run the place, froma castellan or steward all the way down to stable cleaners.These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract thatincludes a place to live within the stronghold as part of thecompensation.\n\nSkilled hirelings include anyone employed to performa service that involves a proficiency (including weapon,tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. Thepay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings requiremore pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial workthat requires no particular skill and can include laborers,porters, maids, and similar workers.\n\nMAGIC ITEMS\n\nOf the many rewards available to adventurers, magic itemsare perhaps the most coveted. These powerful objects arecreated using raw magic and are incredibly complicated toproduce. Few beings in the world possess the knowledgeto make magic items, which makes them hard to find andvaluable.\n\nThe GM is the ultimate arbiter of where magic itemsappear, but they are often given as rewards for crawlingthrough deadly dungeons or slaying the creatures thatguard them.\n\nUSING A MAGIC ITEM\n\nUsing a magic items properties might mean wearing\n\nor wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must bedonned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet,gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, andrings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield\n\nstrapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders.Aweapon must be held.\n\nIn most cases, a magic item thats meant to be worncan fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magicgarments are made to be easily adjustable, or theymagically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptionsexist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fitonly creatures of a certain size or shape, the GM can rulethat it doesnt adjust.\n\nWhen a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, it is upto GM discretion as to whether the item functions asintended. A ring placed ona tentacle might work, but aserpentfolk with a tail instead of legs cant wear boots.\n\nMULTIPLE ITEMS OF THE SAME KIND\n\nUse common sense to determine whether more than oneof a given kind of magic item can be worn. A charactercant normally wear more than one pair of footwear, onepair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit\n\nof armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You canmake exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circletunder a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks.\n\nPAIRED ITEMS\n\nItems that come in pairssuch as boots, bracers,gauntlets, and glovesimpart their benefits only if bothitems of the pair are worn. For example, a characterwearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a bootof elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either.\n\nATTUNEMENT\n\nSome magic items require a creature to form a bondwith them before their magical properties can be used.This bond is called attunement, and certain items haveaprerequisite for attunement. If the prerequisite is a class,a creature must be a member of that class to attune to theitem. If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creaturequalifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits orfeatures, not from using a magic item or the like.\n\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requiresattunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits,unless its description states otherwise. For example, amagic shield that requires attunement provides the benefitsof anormal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but noneof its magical properties.\n\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend a shortrest focused on only that item while being in physicalcontact with it. This focus can take the form of weaponpractice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item),or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest isinterrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, atthe end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitiveunderstanding of how to activate any magical properties ofthe item, including any necessary command words.\n<PAGE>\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time,and a creature can be attuned to no more than a numberof items equal to its proficiency bonus (PB) at any onetime. Any attempt to attune to an additional item fails;the creature must end its attunement to an item first.Additionally, a creature cant attune to more than one copyof an item. For example, a creature cant attune to morethan one ring of protection at a time.\n\nAcreatures attunement to an item ends if the creatureno longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, ifthe item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes tothe item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunementby spending another short rest focused on the item, unlessthe item is cursed.\n\nACTIVATING AN ITEM\n\nActivating some magic items requires a user to dosomething special, such as holding the item and utteringa command word. The description of an item category orindividual item details how an item is activated. Certainitems use the following rules for their activation.\n\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isnt afunction of the Use an Item action.\n\nCOMMAND WORD\n\nAcommand word is a word or phrase that must be\n\nspoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires acommand word cant be activated in an area where sound isprevented, as in the area of the silence spell.\n\nSPELLS\n\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from theitem. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell ring,doesnt expend any of the users spell slots, and requires nocomponents, unless the items description says otherwise.The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration,and the user of the item must concentrate if the spellrequires concentration. Many items, such as potions,bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spells effectswith their usual duration. Certain items make exceptionsto these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or otherparts ofa spell.\n\nA magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you touse your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell fromthe item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, youchoose which one to use with the item. If you dont have aspellcasting ability, your spellcasting ability modifier is +0for the item, and your PB does apply.\n\nCHARGES\n\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended toactivate their properties. The number of charges an item\n\nhas remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it,as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, whenan item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learnshow many charges it regained.\n\nMAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS\n\nThis section lists some magic items found within theknown universe. Each entry provides key informationabout the item, including its rarity category, whether or notit requires attunement to use, its price, and a description ofits properties.\n\nAmmunition, +1, +2, or +3\n\nWeapon (Any Ammunition), Rarity VariesPrice Varies\n\nYou have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made withthis piece of magic ammunition.

Animal or vegetablematter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lostforever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag,as happens when someone reaches in, there is a 50 percent\n<PAGE>\nchance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creatureinside the bag can use its action to try to escape withasuccessful DC 15 STR (Athletics) check. Another creaturecan use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creatureout, doing so with a successful DC 20 STR (Athletics)check (assuming that creature wasnt also pulled inside thebag). Any creature that that starts its turn inside the bag isdevoured, and its body is destroyed.\n\nThe bag holds up to 1 cubic foot of inanimate,non-organic objects without a fuss. However, once eachday, the bag swallows these types of objects placed in thebag and spits them out into a random plane of existence.The GM determines the time and plane.\n\nIf the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed. Anythingwithin it is transported to a random location on a randomplane determined by the GM.\n\nBag of Holding\n\nWondrous Item, Uncommon 1,000 gp\n\nThis bag has an interior space considerably larger thanits outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at\n\nthe mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bagweighs I5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrievingan item from the bag requires an action.\n\nIf the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures andis destroyed, and its contents are scattered in another planeof existence. If the bag is turned inside out, its contentsspill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right beforeit can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag cansurvive up to a number of minutes equal to Io divided bythe number of creatures (minimum I minute), after whichtime they begin to suffocate.\n\nPlacing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional spacecreated by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar iteminstantly destroys both items and opens a gate to anotherplane. The gate originates where the one item was placedinside the other. Any creature within ro feet of the gateis sucked through it to a random location within another\n\nwithin the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures thatsucceed on the save, or are partially within the area, arepushed away from the center of the sphere until they are nolonger inside it. Only breathable air can pass through thespheres wall. No attack or other effect can.\n\nAn enclosed creature can use its action to push against thespheres wall, moving the sphere up to half the creatureswalking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magiccauses it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight ofcreatures inside.\n\nCrystal Ball\n\nWondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)Price Varies\n\nThe typical crystal ball is a very rare magic item about 6inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast thescrying spell (save DC 17) with it.\n\nThe following crystal ball variants are legendary items andhave additional properties.\n\nCrystal Ball of Mind Reading. You can use an action tocast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 17) while you arescrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you cansee within 30 feet of the spells sensor. You dont need toconcentrate to maintain detect thoughts for the duration ofthe spell, but it ends if scrying ends.\n\nCrystal Ball of Telepathy. While scrying with the crystalball, you can communicate telepathically with creaturesyou can see within 30 feet of the spells sensor. You canalso use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. Youdont need to concentrate to maintain suggestion forthe duration of the spell, but it ends if scrying ends. Thesuggestion power of the crystal ball cant be used againuntil the next dawn.\n\nCrystal Ball of True Seeing.

More weight causes the rod todeactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make\n\na DC 30 STR check, moving a fixed rod up to Io feet onasuccess.\n\nOil of Slipperiness\n\nPotion, Uncommon 350 gp\n\nThis sticky, black unguent is thick and heavy in thecontainer, but it flows quickly when poured. The oilcan cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with theequipment it wears and carries (one additional vial isrequired for each size category above Medium). Applyingthe oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gainsthe effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as anaction, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating theeffect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\n\nPotion of Healing\n\nPotion, Rarity Varies Price Varies\n\nThis red, glimmering potion allows you to regain hitpoints when you drink it.

If the spell is on your circles spell list, youcan read the scroll and cast its spell without providing anymaterial components. Otherwise, it is unintelligible.\n\nCasting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spellsnormal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words onthe scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting isinterrupted, the scroll is not lost.\n\nIf the spell is on your circles spell list but of a higher levelthan you can normally cast, you must make an ability checkusing your spellcasting ability to determine whether youcast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spells ring. Ona failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with noother effect.\n\nThe spell ring determines the scrolls rarity, save DC,attack bonus, and price, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\n\nAn arcane circle spell ona spell scroll can be copiedjust as spells in spellbooks can be copied.

Magic is themanipulation of those energies to change reality. Thosewho can harness such energies are called spellcasters.\n\nSpellcasters are categorized into groups based on thesource of their power. Regardless of sources, the laws thatrule these reality-shaping effects, known as spells, are thesame. This section outlines the rules of spellcasting andincludes a selection of commonly seen spells.\n\nWHAT IS A SPELL?\n\nA spell is a manipulation of reality accomplished using\n\na combination of will and energy. Every spell must haveenergy to fuel its effects and a spellcaster capable ofcontrolling the flow of energy. Spells can accomplish anynumber of thingsharm, protection, problem-solvingall guided by a casters imagination.\n\nCreating a new spell is a work of extreme creativity andintense effort, often resulting from a lifetime of study.Because of this, most casters choose their spells fromestablished pools of knowledge.\n\nCIRCLES OF MAGIC\n\nCircles of magic represent primary sources that fuelspellcaster abilities. This section details two circles of magic,arcane and divine, and explains their roles in spellcasting.\n\nARCANE CIRCLE\n\nThe arcane circle draws its power from manipulatingmeasurable forces that govern material reality. Thisincludes forces like heat, space, and gravity. An arcanecaster uses a precise combination of words, gestures, andmaterials to ignite a roaring flame or link two locationshundreds of miles apart.\n\nArcane magic is governed by an extensive set of rulesand calculations, which a caster uses to enact effects. Itcan resemble a science more than mystical workings.Harnessing magic from this circle requires creativity,precision, and a drive for perfection.\n\nThe tools of arcane magic are varied and often highlypersonal to the caster. Common tools include runes,recitations, and hand gestures.\n\nConversion from 5th Edition. When converting fifthedition spells into circles of magic, these qualities indicatethat a spell might be arcane:\n\nâ€¢ The spell detects, suppresses, ends, or otherwise\n\ninteracts with mechanical aspects of spellcasting.\n\nâ€¢ The spell harnesses elemental energy (acid, cold, fire,\n\nlightning, or thunder).\n\nâ€¢ The spell interacts with the five senses, whether to foolthem or to extend their capabilities.\n\nDIVINE CIRCLE\n\nThe divine circle draws its power from the connectivitybetween beings. A divine caster can imbue a dying creaturewith the will to live, channel the wrath of a god into a firestorm, or restore withered crops to a starving community.\n\nDivine magic requires a connection between the casterand at least one other being to function. Harnessing magicfrom this circle requires devotion, awareness of others, andbelief in improving the world for those served.\n\nThe common model for divine magic frames it withinreligious faith, where an individual enacts the will of a god.However, the divine circle is also accessible to a caster whoacts out of devotion to a particular community, an evilpact set forth by a cult, or any similarly compelling source.Wherever need exists, there is the potential for divinemagic.\n\nConversion from 5th Edition. When converting fifthedition spells into circles of magic, these qualities indicatethat a spell might be divine:\n\nâ€¢ The spell specifically interacts with another creatureslife force, whether to heal or harm.\n\nâ€¢ The spell harnesses radiant or necrotic energy.\n\nâ€¢ The spell specifies interaction with a deity or includesthe word faith in the description.\n<PAGE>\nSPELL RINGS\n\nEvery spell is categorized into a ring, ranked from Ist tooth. Higher rings require more energy to fuel the spell andhave stronger effects.\n\nLike the rings within a tree trunk, rings of magic encircleone another. A novice spellcaster starts at the center of thecircle with access to the Ist ring. As they grow in ability,their powers expand toward the circles edge, giving accessto more rings. The further a ring is from the center, thehigher level a spellcaster must be to use that rings spells.\n\nEach class provides a table of what spellcaster level youmust achieve before you gain access to new spell rings.Typically, a spellcaster must be at least 17th level beforethey can cast spells from the 9th and final ring.\n\nSPELL SLOTS\n\nSpell slots are a measure of the energy a caster has tofuel their spells. Check the progression table for yourspellcasting class to see how many spell slots your characterhas at a given level. As you gain levels, you gain new slots tocast spells from higher rings and more slots for spells fromlower rings.\n\nAcaster who has used all their spell slots is spent,physically and mentally. Theyre out of energy for spells.To replenish spell slots, you must complete a short or longresteach class specifies which type of rest and how manyslots you regain. This rest represents the time needed torecover from the toll spellcasting takes on the body andmind.\n\nSCHOOLS OF MAGIC\n\nPractitioners and sages have attempted to quantify andcategorize the complexities of magic into eight universallyrecognized categories known as spell schools. Theseschools have no inherent influence ona spell, but they helpidentify a spells effect. Specific class features or characterabilities may refer to these schools. The eight schools arebroadly explained in this section.\n\nABJURATION\n\nAbjuration spells use wards, shields, and other means ofdeflection to defend their target. Such spells might looklike creating a force shield to block incoming missiles orimbuing a homestead with a ward to deter unwanted pests.\n\nCONJURATION\n\nConjuration spells restructure space, enabling objects,creatures, and other targets to be transported from place toplace. Such spells might look like causing a lost house keyto appear in your hand or creating a portal that allows forinstantaneous travel to a far-flung realm of existence.\n\nDIVINATION\n\nDivination spells collect information, allowing a user toglean locations, outcomes, or sensory feedback beyond thelimitations of standard perception. Such spells might looklike sensing the location of a hidden entrance or receiving avision of future events.\n\nENCHANTMENTEnchantment spells influence the minds of creatures,allowing a user to manipulate emotions or behavior.\n\nEVOCATION\n\nEvocation spells shape energy, allowing a user to channelhealing, change air into roaring flame, or stir the skies intoa raging storm.\n\nILLUSIONIllusion spells deceive the senses, allowing a user to maskor alter the truth and create objects that seem real.\n\nNECROMANCYNecromancy spells manipulate life, allowing a user to useanothers life force to heal or reanimate the dead.\n\nTRANSMUTATION\n\nTransmutation spells alter the forms of creatures orobjects, allowing a user to turn lead into gold or transforman enemy into a toad.\n\nKNOWN SPELLS\n\nA spellcaster must be extremely familiar with a spell orpossess a magic item imbued with the spell to cast it. Eachspellcasting class solves this familiarity issue differently.\n\nFor example, a wizard catalogs their known spells inaspellbook and adds to it whenever they discover a new spell.Your character class defines how many spells you know andcan potentially learn as you gain more class levels.\n\nPREPARED SPELLS\n\nA prepared spell is ready to cast quickly, in the heat ofbattle, without extensive reading or setup. Due to theintense mental fortitude necessary, the number of spells acaster can prepare at one time is generally limited.\n\nSome spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, mustprepare all their spells ahead of time through study ormeditation. Different spellcasting classes with shorterknown spell lists can automatically prepare all their knownspells.\n\nYour character class defines what you must do to preparespells and how many spells you can have prepared at anygiven level.\n<PAGE>\nCANTRIPS\n\nBONUS ACTION\n\nSome spellcasters can employ a simple type of spell calledacantrip. A cantrip can be cast without using a spell slotand without being prepared. Repeated practice has fixedthe spell in the casters mind and infused the caster with theenergy needed to produce the effect on demand. A cantripsspell ring is o.\n\nYour class defines whether you can access cantrips, andhow many cantrips you knowat each class level.\n\nRITUALS\n\nRitual spells are uniquely powerful magic that takes 1minute or longer to cast and often requires costly materialcomponents. A caster can only learn ritual spells associatedwith their circle of magic.\n\nRitual spells dont use spell slots. Otherwise, ritual spellsfollow normal spellcasting rules.\n\nYour character class defines whether you can access ritualspells, and how many rituals you know at each class level.\n\nCASTING IN ARMOR\n\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures requiredfor spellcasting, you must be proficient with any armor youare wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distractedand hampered for spellcasting.\n\nCOMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS\n\nThe effects of different spells combine while the durationsof those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell castmultiple times dont combine, however. Instead, the mostpotent effect, such as the highest bonus from multiplecastings, applies while their durations overlap.\n\nFor example, if two wizards cast mage armor on the sametarget, that target gains the spells benefit only once; theydont get multiple AC bonuses.\n\nELEMENTS OF A SPELL\n\nWhen a character casts a spell, the basic rules are the sameregardless of the spell ring or its circle.\n\nEach spell in this chapter includes basic information,including the spells name, ring, circle, school, castingtime, range, required components, and duration. Everyspell also contains a description of its effect.\n\nCASTING TIME\n\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some can beaccomplished in a shorter or longer span.\n\nA spell cast with a bonus action is fast. You must use abonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided youhavent already taken a bonus action this turn. If you useyour bonus action to cast a spell from the Ist ring or higheron your turn, you cant also use your action to cast a spellfrom the Ist ring or higher during the same turn.\n\nREACTION\n\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take\n\na fraction ofa second to bring about and are cast inresponse to specific triggering events. Ifa spell can be castas a reaction, the spell description specifies the triggerrequired.\n\nLONGER CASTING TIMES\n\nCertain spells (particularly rituals) require more time tocast, minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with\n\na casting time longer than a single action or reaction,\n\nyou must spend your action each turn casting, and\n\nyou must maintain concentration while you do so (seeConcentration). If your concentration is broken, the spellfails, but the attempt doesnt use a spell slot. To try castingthe spell again, you must start over.\n\nRANGE\n\nThe target of a spell must be within the spells range. Fora spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. Fora spelllike fireball, the target is a point in space where the ball offire erupts.\n\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells cantarget only a creature (including you) that you touch. Otherspells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spellshavea range of self.\n\nSpells that appear in cones or lines that originate fromyou also have a range of self, indicating that the originpoint must be you (see Area of Effect).\n\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects arent limited by its rangeunless the spells description says otherwise.\n\nAREA OF EFFECT\n\nSpells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area,allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n\nA spells description specifies its area of effect, whichtypically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point oforigin, a location from which the spells energy erupts. Thetules for each shape specify how you position its origin.Usually, the origin is a point in space that you choosewithin the spells range, but some spells originate from acreature or an object.\n<PAGE>\nA spells effect expands in straight lines from its origin.If no unblocked straight line extends from the originto a location within the area of effect, that location isntincluded in the spells area. To block one of these straightlines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\n\nCONE\n\nAcone extends ina direction you choose from its point of\n\norigin. A cones width at a given point along its length is\n\nequal to that points distance from the point of origin. A\n\ncones area of effect specifies its maximum length.Acones point of origin is not included in the cones area\n\nof effect unless you decide otherwise.\n\nCUBEYou select a cubes point of origin, which lies anywhere ona face of the cubic effect.

Each spells description indicateswhether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M)components. If you cant provide one or more of a spellscomponents, you cant cast the spell.\n\nVERBAL (V)\n\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. Thecombination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance,sets the magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gaggedor in an area of silence, such as one created by the silencespell, cant cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\nSOMATIC (S)\n\nSpellcasting might include a forceful gesticulation oran intricate set of motions. Ifa spell requires a somaticcomponent, the caster must have free use of at least onehand to perform these gestures.\n\nMATERIAL (M)\n\nCasting some spells requires specific objects detailed\n\nin parentheses in the component entry.

However, ifa cost is indicated for a component, apouch or focus cant substitute for it.

Some spells specify that their effects last until thespells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\nINSTANTANEOUS\n\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals,creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that cantbe dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\nSome spells require concentration to keep the magic active.If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that factappears in its duration entry, and it specifies how long youcan concentrate on it. You can end concentration at anytime (no action required).\n\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesntinterfere with concentration. The following factors canbreak concentration:\n\nâ€¢ Casting another spell that requires concentration.You lose concentration ona spell if you cast anotherspell that requires concentration. You cant concentrateon two spells at once.\n<PAGE>\ne Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while youare concentrating on a spell, you must make a CONsave to maintain your concentration. The DC of thissave equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichevernumber is higher. If you take damage from multiplesources, such as an arrow and a dragons breath, youmake a separate save for each source of damage.\n\nâ€¢ Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentrationona spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.\n\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmentalphenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while youreona storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a CONsave to maintain concentration ona spell.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nEach spell includes a description of its effects, includingkey information about how the spell works.\n\nTARGETS\n\nAtypical spell requires you to pick one or more targets tobe affected by the spells magic. A spell tells you whetherthe spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin foran area of effect (described in the Area of Effect section).\n\nUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature mightnot know it was targeted bya spell at all. An effect likecrackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect,such as an attempt to read a creatures thoughts, typicallygoes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n\nSPELL LISTS\n\nA CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGETTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so itcant be behind total cover.\n\nIf you place an area of effect at a point that you cant seeand an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and thepoint, the point of origin comes into being on the near sideof that obstruction.\n\nTARGETING YOURSELF\n\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can chooseyourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specificallya creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of aspell you cast, you can target yourself.\n\nSPELL SAVES\n\nMany spells specify that a target can make a save to avoidsome or all ofa spells effects. The spell specifies the abilitythe target uses for the save and what happens ona successor failure.\n\nThe DC to resist a spell equals 8 + the casters spellcastingability modifier + the casters PB + any special modifiers.\n\nSPELL ATTACK ROLLS\n\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll todetermine whether the spell effect hits the intended target.Acasters attack bonus with a spell attack equals theirspellcasting ability modifier + their PB.\n\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve rangedattacks.

The GM can use Doom\n\nto influence the results of creature die rolls, turning thetide on the player characters (PC) or helping a creaturelast just one turn longer. The GM can spend Doom in thefollowing ways:\n\nâ€¢ Give a creature advantage on an attack rollâ€¢ Give a PC disadvantage on a save\n\nâ€¢ Once per encounter, refresh, recharge, or otherwisegain one additional use of a limited-use feature,such as a dragons Breath Weapon, a legendarycreatures Legendary Resistance, or a spell in a magesSpellcasting.\n\nDoom is optional and exists to give creatures some extra\n\nstaying power against particularly powerful, crafty, or\n\nresourceful PCs. Keep in mind, Doom doesnt have to be\n\nused in every combat encounter. As a GM, consider using\n\nDoom in an encounter if:\n\nâ€¢ The combat encounter is likely the only combat\n\nencounter the PCs will face that day, and the PCs arewell-rested.\n\nâ€¢ You have multiple experienced players.â€¢ You have more than four players.\n\nâ€¢ Your players characters have extra magic items,resources, optimized statistics, or similar aspects thatmake them tougher than average PCs.\n\nâ€¢ Ifthe encounter is particularly significant to the story,such as the fight against the leader of an antagonisticorganization working against the PCs, the final fight ofa major story arc, or a climactic fight against a powerfulantagonist.\n\nDOOM BY ENCOUNTER TIER0-45-89-1213-1617-2021+\n\nHDym;~R][W)rmo]\n\nHow 70 USE THESE MONSTERS\n\nRules for understanding the statistics of monsters (oftencalled Wcreatures) are described in this chapter. If youre aGame Master (GM), look this over and familiarize yourselfwith the elements of a creature and its statistics beforeusing a creature in your game.\n\nDescription and Lore. Each creature entry includesan italicized description of it as well as lore describingthe creatures origins, typical motives, and similar. Theitalicized description at the top of each entry is written as ifthe player characters (PCs) just stumbled upon the creatureand often can be read aloud to your players when theircharacters first encounter the creature.\n\nELEMENTS OF A STAT BLOCK\n\nThe information you need to use a creature in your game\n\nis organized into an easy-reference format called a statblock. This section describes the meaning of the terms inastat block and the contents of each heading within the statblock. Note that each creatures stat block has been writtenand organized with an eye toward making creatures fasterand easier to use during your game, including displayingthe precalculated results for ability checks, damage, abilityscores, and other calculations.\n\n\n<PAGE>\nNAME\n\nThis is what most people call this kind of creature. Somecreatures have alternate names, regional names, or evenspecific titles, all of which are included in its lore.\n\nCHALLENGE RATING\n\nAcreatures challenge rating (CR) tells you how great athreat the creature is. An appropriately equipped andwell-rested party of four adventurers should be able todefeat a creature with a CR equal to its level withoutsuffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-levelcharacters should find a creature with a CR of3 to beaworthy challenge, but not a deadly one.\n\nCreatures that are significantly weaker than ist-levelcharacters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Creatureswith a rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers;those with no effective attacks are worth 0 experiencepoints (XP), while those that have attacks are worth Io XPeach.\n\nSome creatures present a greater challenge than even atypical 2oth-level party can handle. These creatures havea CR of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to testplayer skill.\n\nUSING CHALLENGE RATING\n\nCR ranges from 0 up to 30, with fractions of 1/8, 1/4, and1/2 between o and 1. In addition to helping determine thechallenge compared to a party of PCs, CR can also helpcompare the challenge of one creature to another. Forinstance, a CR 2 creature is significantly less challengingthan a CR 8 creature.\n\nDepending on the level of the PCs, creatures within arange of CRs tend to work better than those outside of thisrange. A CR thats significantly lower than the PC partylevel doesnt provide sufficient challenge. A CR thats toohigh can be frustrating or even deadly to the PCs.\n\nThe PC Level to Creature CR Comparison table showsthe range of creature CRs that tend to match well with PCsof a given level. The lower number represents the lowestCR likely to challenge the PCs (often in massed numbers),while the higher number represents the highest creatureCR the PCs can likely defeat in combat.\n\nPC LEVEL TO CREATURE CR COMPARISON\n\n1 0-1/22-4 1/8-65-10 1-1511-16 3-2117-20 5-30\n\nEXPERIENCE POINTS BY CHALLENGE RATING\n\nCR XP CR XP CR XP\n\n0 0 or 10 9 5,000 21 33,0001/8 25 10 5,900 22 41,0001/4 50 1 7,200 23 50,0001/2 100 12 8,400 24 62,0001 200 3 10,000 25 75,0002 450 14 11,500 26 90,0003 700 5 13,000 27 105,0004 1,100 16 15,000 28 120,0005 1,800 7 18,000 29 135,0006 2,300 18 20,000 30 155,0007 2,900 9 22,000\n\n8 3,900 20 25,000\n\nEXPERIENCE POINTS\n\nThe number of experience points (XP) a creature is worthis based on its CR. Typically, XP is awarded for defeatingacreature, although the GM may also award XP forneutralizing the threat posed by the creature in some othermanner.\n\nSIZE\n\nThis is the relative size of the creature. A creature can beTiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. TheSize Categories table shows how much space a creature of aparticular size occupies on a battle map or grid.\n\nSIZE CATEGORIES\n\nSIZE SPACE EXAMPLES\n\nTiny 2.5 x 2.5 ft. Imp, sprite\n\nSmall 5x5 ft Giant rat, goblinMedium 5x5 ft Orc, werewolf\n\nLarge 10 x 10 ft. Hippogriff, ogreHuge 15 x 15 ft. Fire giant, treantGargantuan 20 x 20 ft. or larger Kraken, purple worm\n\nTYPE\n\nAcreatures type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certainspells, magic items, class features, and other effects interactin special ways with creatures of a particular type. Forexample, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage tocreatures of the dragon type, such as red dragons, dragonturtles, and wyverns. Here is an overview of each of thecreature types. For a more detailed look at creature types,see Chapter 3.\n\nAberrations are utterly alien beings. Many haveinnate magical abilities drawn from the creatures alienmind rather than the mystical forces of the world.Quintessential aberrations are creatures like aboleths,chuul, and gibbering mouthers.\n<PAGE>\nBeasts are living creatures of the natural world. Beastsinclude all varieties of wild animals, domesticated animals,and enormous creatures such as whales and dinosaurs.\n\nCelestials dwell in higher realms outside of measurableor material reality. Many are servants of deities, acting asmessengers, heralds, or agents in the mortal realm. Most ofthem lean innately toward forces of good and order. All ofthem strive to oppose or destroy Fiends. Celestials includebeings like angels, couatls, and pegasi.\n\nConstructs are made, not born. Often built of metal,stone, or wood, some are charged by their creators to followa simple set of instructions, while others are given sentienceand use independent thought. Golems, mechadrons, andclockwork creatures are iconic constructs.\n\nDragons are large, reptilian creatures of ancient originand tremendous power. True dragons are highly intelligent,have innate magic, and grow in power as they increase inage, called age categories. The dragon creature type alsoincludes creatures distantly related to true dragons, but lesspowerful, less magical, and often less intelligent, such aswyverns and pseudodragons.\n\nElementals are creatures born of raw elemental forces.Some creatures of this type are little more than animatemasses of their respective elements, including the creaturessimply called elementals. Others have biological formsinfused with elemental energy. Elemental creatures includebeings like genies, azers, and invisible stalkers.\n\nFey are magical creatures bound to the forces of nature.They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In someworlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild or the BrightLands, also called the Plane of Fey. Some are also found inthe Outer Planes, particularly in the Shadow Realm. Feyinclude dryads, sprites, and satyrs.\n\nFiends dwell in lower realms outside of measurable ormaterial reality. A few are servants of deities, but manymore labor under the leadership of archdevils and demonprinces. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiendsto the material world to do their bidding. Most fiends leaninnately toward forces of evil and chaos. All of them striveto oppose or destroy Celestials. Fiends include demons,devils, hell hounds, and rakshasas.\n\nGiants are enormous, powerful beings that tower overlesser creatures. They are humanlike in shape, though somebear unique adaptations that allow them to thrive in theharsh environments they claim. True giants include stonegiants, fire giants, and cloud giants, but this category alsoincludes lesser giants, such as ogres and trolls.\n\nHumanoids are usually bipedal and often warm-blooded,including humans and a prodigious variety of otherlineages. The most common Humanoids are the lineagesavailable to player characters (PCs), including humans,dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous arebeings like goblinoids, gnolls, and lizardfolk.\n\nMonstrosities are monsters in the strictest sensefrightening, abnormal creatures, not truly natural, andalmost never benign. Some are the result of magicalexperimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), others arethe product of terrible curses (such as chimeras), and manyare monstrous animals (such as griffons). Monstrositiesdefy categorization, and in some sense, serve as a catch-allcategory for creatures that dont fit another type.\n\nOozes are gelatinous predators without fixed forms.These mindless eating machines consume anythingthey can dissolve, living or otherwise. They are mostlysubterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feedingon refuse, carrion, or living creatures unlucky enough toget in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes areamong the most recognizable oozes.\n\nPlants are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora.\n\nMost are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. Thequintessential plants are the shambling mound and thetreant. Fungal creatures such as shriekers and mycolidsalso fall into this category.\n\nUndead are formerly living creatures brought to a stateof undeath through the practice of necromantic magic,dark rites, or curses. Undead creatures include mindlessanimated corpses like zombies, potent predators likevampires, and tormented souls that lack a body, like ghostsor specters.\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nSome creatures fall into categories that are a bit morespecific than their creature types but not as gamerule-related as tags. This categorization denotes thecreatures are more closely related to each other than theyare to other creatures of their same creature type, butthere arent many, if any at all, game rules that referenceor rely on that category. Categories are especially helpfulwhen determining which creatures might be foundtogether or working alongside each other. For example,bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins are all part of thegoblin family, regularly work together, and often inhabitthe same areas. As such, they are listed as Goblin,Creature Name in this book.\n\nTAGS\n\nCreatures may have various tags that further specify theircreature type. Ifa creature has a tag, it appears as part ofthe creatures stat block in parentheses after size and type.Tags indicate creatures that can be targeted by specificspells, magic items, and other features available to PCs.For example, the moonbeam spell has special effects againstcreatures with the Shapechanger tag.\n\nIfa creature has a subtag, the creature is considered tobe both its tag and its subtag, though only the subtag islisted in the creatures stat block. For example, a werewolfis both a Lycanthrope and a Shapechangerthough only\n<PAGE>\nLycanthrope is listed in its stat blockand it is affectedby spells, magic items, and other features that affectShapechangers or Lycanthropes. The following are themost commonly used tags and their associated subtags:\n\nAnimal. A creature that is not of the Beast type but sharesenough characteristics with Beasts that it can be affectedby spells, features, or other abilities that specifically targetBeasts, such as the speak with animals spell.\n\nGolem. A specific type of Construct that is almost alwayshumanoid in shape, is typically crafted wholly out of aspecific material, and has some magical connection toits creator. This connection might be that the golem wasmade from the remains of the creators loved one, madewith some of the creators blood, made from an object withgreat sentimental significance to the creator, or some otherobject or material personal to the creator.\n\nOutsider. A creature from another plane or realm notbound by laws of material or measurable reality. Thereare a wide range of Outsiders from a variety of planes andrealms. Some of the most common Outsiders are Angels,Demons, and Devils, which are defined as the following:\n\nâ€¢ Angel. A specific kind of Celestial Outsider bound inservice to gods of good and order.\n\nâ€¢ Demon. A specific type of Fiend Outsider bound to theforces of evil and chaos.\n\nâ€¢ Devil. A specific type of Fiend Outsider bound inservice to gods or fiendish lords of evil and order.\n\nShapechanger. A creature capable of changing form,such as werewolves, doppelgangers, and vampires. This tagapplies only to creatures with the natural ability to changetheir shape. It doesnt apply to creatures that use magicwhether or not that magic is innate to the creaturetochange their shape, such as gold dragons.\n\nâ€¢ Lycanthrope. A specific kind of HumanoidShapechanger that changes its shape due to ananimalistic curse called lycanthropy, allowing thecreature to transform to and from an Animal form, itsHumanoid form, and a hybrid of the two. The curse istypically passed by an attack from another Lycanthropeor by the creature having a Lycanthrope parent.Though all Lycanthropes are Shapechangers, not allShapechangers are Lycanthropes.\n\nARMOR CLASS (AC)\n\nArmor Class represents the creatures defenses, oftenabbreviated to AC. The higher the number, the moredifficult the creature is to hit in combat.\n\nThe armor a creature uses (if any) is placed in parenthesesafter the AC value to help GMs alter the number if thecreatures armor is removed in some special circumstance.\n\nThe AC included in each stat block has been calculatedusing the following formula. Keep in mind that AC iscalculated before proficiency bonus (PB) is added to the\n\nAbility Modifiers as explained in the Ability Modifierssection, presented later in this chapter:AC =10 + DEX modifier + Any Additional Bonuses(from equipment, natural armor, or special traits)\n\nHIT POINTS (HP)\n\nHit Points represent the health and vitality of the creature,often abbreviated to HP. The higher the number, the harderit is to kill or knock out the creature. Unlike PCs, creaturestypically die or are destroyed when reduced to o HP.\n\nSPEED\n\nAcreatures speed defines how far it can move during asingle round of combat. Ifthe creature has multiple waysto move (such as swimming or flying), those are also listedin this section. All creatures have a walking speed, simplycalled speed. Creatures with no ground-based movementhave a walking speed of o feet. Some creatures have one ormore of the following additional ways to move.\n\nBURROW\n\nAcreature with a burrowing speed can move through sand,earth, mud, or ice. A creature cant burrow through solidrock unless it has a trait that allows it to do so.\n\nCLIMB\n\nAcreature with a climbing speed can move on verticalsurfaces with no check required. The creature doesnt needto spend extra movement to climb.\n\nFLY\n\nAcreature with a flying speed can move by flying. Somecreatures can hover, which makes them hard to knockout of the air. Such a creature stops hovering when itdies. If a creature can hover, the word hover appears inparenthesis after its fly speed.\n\nSWIM\n\nAcreature with a swimming speed can move easily through\n\nliquid and doesnt need to spend extra movement to swim.\n\nUSING DIFFERENT SPEEDS\n\nIf a creature has more than one speed, such as a walkingspeed and a flying speed, it can switch back and forthbetween its speeds during its move. Whenever the creatureswitches, subtract the distance the creature has alreadymoved from the new speed. The result determines howmuch farther the creature can move. If the result is 0\n\nor less, the creature cant use the new speed during thecurrent move.\n\nFor example, if a creature has a speed of 30 and a flyingspeed of 60, the creature could fly 20 feet, then walk 10feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\n<PAGE>\nPERCEPTION\n\nThe Perception Value shows how observant the creatureis, regardless of whether its actively looking around. ThisPerception Value is calculated using a creatures Wisdom(WIS).\n\nA PC attempting to hide from, sneak around, or stagea surprise attack against a creature must make a DEX(Stealth) check. If the result is equal to or higher than thecreatures Perception Value, the PC succeeds and remainsundetected. If it is lower, the PC fails, and the creaturedetects the character.\n\nFor instance, a goblin has a Perception Value of 9. A PCmust roll a9 or better on a DEX (Stealth) check to sneakpast it.\n\nThe Perception Value included in each stat block has beencalculated using the following formula. Some creaturesare naturally perceptive, which allows them to add their PBor even double their PB when calculating their PerceptionValue. In such cases, the Perception value in the stat blockalready includes that bonus.\n\nPerception Value=10 + WIS modifier\n\nSTEALTH\n\nThe Stealth Value shows how readily a creature evadesnoticeeither to sneak around or stage a surprise attack.Stealth is calculated using a creatures Dexterity (DEX).\n\nA PC searching for unseen foes must make a WIS(Perception) check. Ifthe result is equal to or higher thanthe creatures Stealth score, the PC succeeds and detectssigns of the creature. If it is lower, the PC fails, and thecreature remains undetected.\n\nFor instance, a goblin has a Stealth Value of 14. A PC mustrolla 14 or better on a WIS (Perception) check to detect thegoblin when it is trying to hide.\n\nThe Stealth Value included in each stat block has beencalculated using the following formula. Some creaturesare naturally stealthy, which allows them to add their PB oreven double their PB when calculating their Stealth Value.In such cases, the Stealth value in the stat block alreadyincludes that bonus.\n\nStealth Value = 10 + DEX modifier\n\nIMMUNE, RESISTANT, AND VULNERABLE\n\nSome creatures are vulnerable, resistant, or immune tocertain kinds of damage or conditions. Particular creaturesare even vulnerable, resistant, or immune to damage fromnonmagical attacks. A magical attack is an attack deliveredby a spell, a magic item, or another magical source.Multiple Protective Sources. Multiple instances of acreature being resistant or vulnerable to a type of damagecount as only one instance. For example, if a creaturehas resistance to fire damage, such as a from its natural\n\ncapabilities or the protection from energy spell, as well asresistance to nonmagical damage, such as from the gaseousform spell, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced byhalf against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n\nConditions and Damage. Each creature has only one linefor each of the following categories. This means a creatureresistant to cold damage and the grappled condition listsboth cold and grappled in the Resistant line. In many cases,a creature being vulnerable, resistant, or immune toacondition is due to its creature type, which is noted as theassociated traits name in the appropriate category line anddetailed in the traits section of the stat block.\n\nVULNERABLE\n\nIfa creature is vulnerable to a type of damage and it takesdamage of that type, the damage is doubled against thecreature. For instance, a creature vulnerable to fire damagetakes double damage from a fireball spell or flaming oil.\n\nA creature that is vulnerable to a condition hasdisadvantage on checks and saves made to avoid becomingaffected by that condition or to end it.\n\nRESISTANT\n\nIfa creature is resistant to a type of damage and it takesdamage of that type, the damage is halved (rounded down)against the creature.\n\nAcreature that is resistant to a condition has advantageon checks and saves made to avoid becoming affected bythat condition or to end it.\n\nIMMUNE\n\nIfa creature is immune to a type of damage, it doesnt takedamage of that type or lose hit points when subjected tothat type of damage. Ifa spell, class feature, or other effectdeals damage of a type to which a creature is immuneand has an extra effect, such as causing the charmedor frightened condition, the creature doesnt take thatdamage, but it might still be subjected to that extra effect.For example, a creature immune to bludgeoning damagewould be immune to the bludgeoning damage of anotyughs Tentacle Slam, but it might still become stunned ifit fails the CON save from Tentacle Slam.\n\nAcreature that is immune to a condition automaticallysucceeds on checks and saves to avoid the condition andotherwise cant be affected by that condition.\n\nSENSES\n\nCreatures primarily perceive the world by sight. This iscalled vision. Creatures usually have secondary sensesof hearing, smell, and touch that also allow them tointeract with the environment, but vision is considered thestandard primary sense.\n\nIfa creature has no unusual sensory capacity, this section\n\n\n<PAGE>\nis marked with . Ifa creature has a specialized sensethat allows it to perceive in some way other than vision, itis noted in the senses line, followed by a radius in feet thatdefines the senses maximum range. Specialized sensesthat appear ina stat block:\n\nDARKVISION\n\nAcreature with darkvision can see in nonmagical darkness.The creature can see in dim light within the radius as if\n\nit were bright light and can see in darkness as if it were\n\ndim light. A creature cant discern color in darkness, onlyshades of gray. Many nocturnal creatures and creaturesthat live underground have this special sense.\n\nKEENSENSE\n\nAcreature with keensense can perceive its surroundingsusing a sense other than vision. Creatures withoutvision, such as morlocks and gelatinous cubes, typicallyhave this sense, as do creatures with echolocation or an\n\nextraordinary sense of smell, such as bats and true dragons.\n\nIfacreature has no other form of sensing, it has aparenthetical note to this effect, indicating that theradius of its keensense defines the maximum range of itsperception.\n\nTREMORSENSE\n\nAcreature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint thesource of vibrations if it and the source are in contact withthe same ground or substance. Tremorsense cant detectflying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures,such as ankhegs and purple worms, have this special sense.\n\nTRUESIGHT\n\nAcreature with truesight can see clearly in normal andmagical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects,automatically detect and succeed on saves against visualillusions, and perceive the original form of a Shapechangeror creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, thecreature can see into the Ethereal Plane within range.\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nThe languages that a creature can speak are listed inalphabetical order. Ifa creature can understand a languagebut cant speak it, this is noted on this line. A _indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understandsany language. Most languages are specific to a particularheritage or culture; a few are based on faith, commerce, ortravelers tongues.\n\nTELEPATHY\n\ntelepathic conversation at will, without using an action,like talking. A telepathic creature doesnt need to see acontacted creature to communicate, it just needs to bein range.\n\nA telepathic creature can communicate with a creaturethat doesnt have telepathy. The contacted creature doesntneed to share a language with the telepathic creature tocommunicate, but it must be able to understand at leastone language. The contacted creature can receive andrespond to telepathic messages, but it cant start or endtelepathic communication.\n\nContact breaks if two creatures are no longer withinrange of each other or if the telepathic creature contactsa different creature. While a telepathic creature isincapacitated, it cant start telepathy, and any contact ends.\n\nA creature in an antimagic field or in any location wheremagic doesnt function cant send or receive telepathicmessages.\n\nABILITY MODIFIERS\n\nEvery creature has six ability modifiers: Strength (STR),Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT),Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA). These modifiers areused to determine pre-calculated elements of a stat block(like attack and damage). More importantly, the GM usesthem whenever a creature must make:\n\nâ€¢ Asave. The GM rolls a d20 and adds the relevant ability\n\nmodifier.\n\nâ€¢ Anability check. The GM rolls a d2o and addswhichever ability modifier is most relevant.\n\nIfa creature is particularly good at checks and savesinvolving a certain ability, the creatures proficiency bonus(PB) has already been added into the ability modifierspresented in the stat block. You dont need to add PB toany number ina stat blockits already calculated for you.\n\nTRAITS\n\nTraits are a creatures special characteristics that are likelyto be relevant in combat. Ina stat block, they appear after acreatures ability modifiers but before any actions.\n\nACTIONS\n\nWhen a creature takes its action, it can choose from theoptions in the Actions section of its stat block or use oneof the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dashor Hide action, as described in the Combat rules (seeChapter 2).\n\nMELEE AND RANGED ATTACKS\n\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature tomentally communicate with another creature within aspecified range. A telepathic creature can start orenda\n\nThe most common actions that a creature takes in combatare melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks orweapon attacks, where the weapon might be a physical\n<PAGE>\nitem ora natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.\n\nCreature vs. Target. The target of a melee or ranged attackis usually either one creature or one target. The differenceis that a target can bea creature, object, or structure.This designator on an attack reflects the creatures naturalinclination, but it doesnt mean a tyrannosaurus rex cantor wont bite at a door to get to a creature it can smell onthe other side. This designator helps reflect that a creaturelike a tyrannosaurus rex isnt likely to strategically attackpillars of a building to make the building collapse on itsprey or to otherwise attack an object or structure in a waythat isnt directly related to reaching its prey.\n\nHit. Any damage dealt and other effects that occur asaresult of an attack hitting a target are described after theHit: notation. In the Alpha Release, you might noticethe math doesnt match up perfectly. Were trying somethings to bring the power curve up a bit. Don*t sweat thearithmetic for now. But do note how the damage valueswork for your table.\n\nMULTIATTACK\n\nAcreature that can make multiple attacks on its turn hasthe Multiattack action. A creature cant use Multiattackwhen making an opportunity attack, which must beasingle melee attack.\n\nAMMUNITION\n\nAcreature carries enough ammunition to make itsranged attacks. A creature generally has 2d4 pieces ofammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 piecesof ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow orcrossbow.\n\nSPELLCASTING\n\nAcreature with the Spellcasting action is capable ofcasting spells through innate magical talent. Unless notedotherwise, a spell of Ist ring or higher is always cast at itslowest possible ring and cant be cast at a higher ring. Ifacreature has a cantrip where its spellcaster level mattersand no level is given, use the creatures challenge rating.\n\nAcreature doesnt adhere to the tenets, restrictions, orrequirements of specific spellcasting classes, circles ofmagic, or similar spellcasting structures found amongplayer characters, as a creatures spellcasting is unique tothe creature. A creatures spells cant be swapped out withother spells.\n\nSPELL ATTACKS AND SAVE DCS\n\nThe Spellcasting action always lists the creaturesspellcasting ability and the spell save DC for its spells.When a spell requires a spell attack roll, use the creaturesspellcasting ability modifier + the creatures proficiencybonus to determine the creatures total spell attack bonus.\n\nSPELL COMPONENTS\n\nThe Spellcasting action always notes if the creature doesntneed to use a particular type of spell component, such\n\nas material components. If no exception is listed in thecreatures Spellcasting action, the creature must provide allnecessary components to cast the spell. For the purposes ofcasting a spell, a creature needs free use of at least one limbto produce gestures for somatic components rather thanspecifically free use of one hand.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\n\nIfa creature can do something special with its bonusaction, that information is contained here. If a creature hasno special bonus action, this section is absent.\n\nREACTIONS\n\nIfacreature can do something special with its reaction,that information is contained here. If a creature has nospecial reaction, this section is absent.\n\nLIMITED USAGE\n\nSome traits or actions have restrictions on the number oftimes they can be used. Common examples:\n\nX/Day. This means a special ability can be used alimited number of times in a day, where X is a number(often I or 3). The creature must finish a long rest toregain expended uses.\n\nFor example, 1/Day means a special ability can be usedonce and then the creature must finish a long rest to use itagain.\n\nRecharge X-Y. This means a creature can use a specialability once. Afterward, the ability has a random chanceof recharging during each round of combat. X and Yare values on a d6 (often 5 and 6). At the start of each ofthe creatures turns, roll a d6. Ifthe result is in the range ofnumbers in the recharge notation, the creature regains theuse of the special ability. The ability also recharges when thecreature finishes a short or long rest.\n\nFor example, Recharge 5-6 means a creature can use thespecial ability once. Then, at the start of the creatures turn,it regains the use of that ability if it rollsa5 or 6 onad6.\n\nRecharge after a Short or Long Rest. This means that acreature can use a special ability once and then must finisha short or long rest to use it again.\n\nConditional. This covers a lot of territory where an abilitycan be used only after a certain condition is met. Thisinformation always appears in parenthesis. For example,Vicious Bound (44 HP or Fewer) means a creature cantuse the Vicious Bound action unless it has 44 hit points(HP) or fewer remaining.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other thanacreatures armor or weapons. A creature that customarilywears clothes, such as a Humanoid, is assumed to bedressed appropriately.\n\nA GM can equip creatures with additional gear and\n<PAGE>\ntrinkets as desired. The GM decides how much ofacreatures equipment is recoverable after it is slain andwhether any of that equipment is still usable. A batteredsuit of armor made for a creature is rarely usable bysomeone else, for instance.\n\nIfa spellcasting creature needs material components tocast its spells, assume that it has what it needs to cast thespells in its stat block.\n\nLEGENDARY CREATURES\n\nA legendary creature can do things that ordinary creaturescant. It can take special actions outside its turn, and itmight exert magical influence for miles around.\n\nIfa creature assumes the form of a legendary creature,such as through a spell, it doesnt gain that formslegendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\n\nLEGENDARY ACTIONS\n\nA legendary creature can take a certain number of specialactionscalled legendary actionsoutside its turn. Onlyone legendary action option can be used at a time and onlyat the end of another creatures turn. A creature regains itsspent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It doesnthave to use them, and it cant use them while incapacitatedor otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it cantuse them until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nLAIRS\n\nA legendary creature might have a section describing its lairand the special effects it can create while there, either by actof will or simply by being present. Such a section appliesonly toa legendary creature that spends a great deal of timein its lair.\n\nLAIR ACTIONS\n\nIf a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them toharness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count20 (Losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair actionoptions. It cant do so while incapacitated or otherwiseunable to take actions. If surprised, it cant use one untilafter its first turn in the combat.\n\nREGIONAL EFFECTS\n\nThe mere presence of a legendary creature can have strangeand wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in thissection. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate overtime when the legendary creature dies.\n\nMONSTERS ATOZ\n\nThis section contains creature entries in alphabetical orderwith Animals and NPCs listed in separate sections at theend.\n\nANIMATED OBJECTS\n\nThe emptiness within the suit of plate mails visor demonstratesthat no creature controls the armor from inside it. An iron swordfloats in midair at restthen suddenly swings and flourishes asthough wielded by a trained swordfighter.\n\nAnimated objects are nonmagical objects given life bya spellcaster. Though little more than their mundanecounterparts, animated objects can be given basicinstructions to follow indefinitely or until given newinstructions by their creators. The most common animatedobjects are decorative or seemingly innocuous armorand weapons instructed to protect their creators homes,laboratories, treasuries, or other locations important totheir creators.\n\nAnimated Armor. Crafted to look like field armor withdents and scratches showing signs of its use in battle, orornately decorated for those who want something moreaesthetically pleasing, animated armor moves as quickly asthose who might wear it. It pummels foes with its gauntletsbut can kick or otherwise ram opponents in the absence ofits gauntlets.\n\nFlying Sword. Often paired with animated armor, aflying sword appears equally as battle-worn or ornate asthe accompanying armor. The sword may also sit alone,innocuous among a rack of weapons, ready to fly out atintruders. Though more maneuverable than most animatedobjects, its fragility makes it easier to destroy.\n\nAnimated Armor CR1\n\nMedium Construct\n\nArmor Class 18 (natural armor)Hit Points 34Speed 25 ft.Perception 8 Stealth 10\n\nVulnerable acid\n\nResistant slashing\n\nImmune Construct Resilience\n\nSenses keensense 60 ft.

Theseaggressive carnivores feed upon whatever creatures theycome across. Their translucent forms are nearly invisible,and they move so rapidly, few creatures realize theirpresence until a jelly begins feasting on them.\n\nSwarming. Crimson jellies reproduce asexually andwith extreme speed. Almost immediately after feeding,the creatures break away from prey and divide.

While in an area of dim or bright light, thecrimson jelly is invisible. While in darkness, creatures withoutdarkvision can see the jellys faint crimson glow.\n\nACTIONS\n\nFeeding Paddles. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The crimsonjelly gains temporary HP equal to the necrotic damage dealt,and it attaches to the target. If the jelly had advantage onthis attack, it attaches to the targets face, leaving the targetunable to breathe or speak while the jelly is attached.\n\nWhile attached, the crimson jelly can use only the FeedingPaddles action, and it moves with the target whenever thetarget moves, requiring none of the jellys movement. TheCrimson jelly can detach itself by spending 5 feet of itsmovement. A creature, including the target, can take itsaction to detach the jelly by succeeding on a DC 12 STRcheck.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\n\nReproduce (Requires Temporary HP). While the crimson jellyhas 1 or more temporary HP, it can split part of itself off intoa new crimson jelly with HP equal to the original crimsonjellys temporary HP.

Without regular trips to other planes, somelesser demons eventually wear away as the reality-bendingchaos consumes them. What remains is known asa huskdemon.\n\nExpunged. Drained by the chaos and endless fury, littleremains of what these demons once were, save for rageand hunger. Husk demons seek to consume the souls ofsentient creatures from other planes, a whisper of theirdemonic form promising relief in the pits of the Abyss, ifonly they can consume enough souls. These demons slurpat the bodies and souls of creatures, steadily leeching thevitality and thirst for life from victims. After a kill, manyhusk demons burn and mutilate their victim with a mark of\n\ntheir patron demon. Whether the husk demon recalls themeaning of the mark remains uncertain.\n\nTied to the Past. Husk demons inhabit the ruins ofdemonic strongholds, ancient demonic prisons, or templeson the Material Plane dedicated to dead gods or infernalexiles. Such sites often contain lost relics and artifactsto which the demons shared a distant connection in life.Experienced scavengers and looters tend to avoid areassaid to be inhabited by husk demons, believing the demonsto be long-dead guardians pressed into service by thepowerful objects themselves.

While serving as familiars, quasits goad theirmasters into vile acts. These acts often start small andsimple, slowly escalating until the master has been fullycorrupted by the quasits influence.\n\nCowardly Shapechangers.

They grab their prey,shaking it and crushing it with their powerful jaws whilewalloping other creatures with their tails. The dinosaursattack their opponents until they or their opponentsare dead.

Its crocodilian maw continually dribbles acid thathisses when it strikes something.\n\nBlack dragons are consummate bullies and aggressivelydefend their lairs against lesser creatures, often makingexamples of those they see as a threat. This also appliesto their mates and their own young, which flee the mostpowerful specimen when they can. Ifa dragon learns abouta settlement encroaching on its swampy domain, it firstsends its allies to drive the interlopers away, and then itmakes a personal visit to destroy any remaining resistance.\n\nCowardly. As bullies, black dragons quail in the face ofsuperior beings, often in the form of larger black dragonsresettling from other swampy lairs or their own youngwho have amassed enough wealth, power, and age tochallenge their sire. When necessary, black dragons engagein ambushes, short raids, and night attacks to underminestronger foes.\n\nGem Hoarders. Conditions force black dragons tocarefully select their treasures. Metal corrodes fromexposure to the dragons acid and the damp air. Papersoaks through and disintegrates. Wood bloats and warps.Enchanted items last longer, but they too ultimatelysuccumb to corrosion. However, gems persist in theunfavorable environment, so black dragons collect asmany as possible. Each dragon has a favorite type of gemthey covet, ranging from sapphires and rubies throughless common stones like tourmalines and garnets. Whilethe dragons dont have deep caverns for their hoards, theshallow waters of the swamps make it relatively simple todredge for stored gems.\n\nLocal Despots. Compared to most chromatic dragons,black dragons content themselves with their own domainand rarely see the need to fly somewhere distant, devastatean area, and plunder from the fallen. They are satisfiedwith waylaying hapless travelers in their territory andretrieving treasure from those claimed by the swampwithout their intervention.\n<PAGE>\nBlack Dragon Wyrmling CR2\n\nMedium Dragon\n\nArmor Class 17 (natural armor)Hit Points 51\n\nSpeed 30 ft., fly 60 ft., swim 30 ft.Perception 14 Stealth 14Immune acid\n\nSenses darkvision 60 ft., keensense 10 ft.\n\nLanguages Draconic\n\nSTR DEX CON INT wis CHA+3 +4 +3 +0 +2 +3\n\nAmphibious.

Powerful, intelligent, and cunning, their attacks rendarmor, and their flaming breath devastates anyone foolish enoughto stand against them. Older red dragons develop additionalattacks and even the ability to cast spells.\n\nAvaricious and Territorial. Most dragons maintainhoards of gold, treasure, and magical items, but the greedof the red dragons is as legendary as their fire. They amassvast troves of wealth, preferring quantity over quality, anddisplay trophies and skulls of slain foes prominently. Reddragons prefer to lair in volcanic caverns within mountainsor subterranean areas of extreme heat. They surround theirhoard chambers with twisting tunnels full of traps andguardians provided by the lesser creatures forced to servethem. Red dragons brook no incursions into their territory,which can stretch for miles around their lairs, and react toany perceived trespass with fury and fire.\n\nDominating Pride. Red dragons truly believe they are themightiest of all dragons and superior to all other creatures.They are quick to boast of their own greatness and happyto demonstrate their supremacy by fang or fire. This pridemakes them tyrannical, and many red dragons delight inforcing tribute or service from lesser creatures.\n\nIncendiary Rage. The magical core of fire at the heart ofevery red dragon both generates their incinerating breathand makes them quick to anger. They take offense at evenslight provocation, flying into devastating rages that lastuntil their fury is vented.\n\nARED DRAGONS LAIR\n\nAred dragon favors high mountains, claiming snowypeaks, fuming volcanoes, or sprawling ancient ruins. A reddragons immense strength, agile flight, and comfort inblistering temperatures make its lair difficult to traverse formost other creatures. From its skyward vantage point, ared dragon peers down at what it considers to be lesser kin.In the most extreme lairs, precariously maintained abovethe churning interior of active volcanoes, red dragons\n<PAGE>\nretain azers, fire elementals, fire giants, and devils ordemons to serve their whims. Sprawling dwarven tunnels,forgotten giant foundries, or lakes of boiling stone makethe perfect respite for a red dragons clutch or nest.\n\nLAIR ACTIONS\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a red dragoncan take one of the following lair actions.

Within 10 miles of the red dragons lair,precipitation is oily and stinks of sulfur. Snow in thearea may be gray or black as it falls, appearing like ash,though its temperature is unchanged.\n\nâ€¢ Incited Rage. Creatures within 3 miles of the reddragons lair are quick to anger and slow to forgive.Such creatures have disadvantage on CHA checks,except CHA (Intimidation), and Beasts in the area thatarent domesticated are more aggressive than normal.\n\nâ€¢ Unnatural Heat. Within 1 mile of the red dragonslair, temperatures are unnaturally high.

It flicks a long tongue out of its mouth, sensing forits next warm meal.\n\nGhouls amass in nightmarish packs to scour the worldfor the flesh of the dead. Though capable hunters, mostghoul packs raid cemeteries and ancient crypts to feast on\n<PAGE>\nputrefied flesh. Forever starving for their next meal, ghoulsnever decay nor age and may prowl the long-forgottenmausoleums of dead civilizations for thousands of years,searching for their next morsel of flesh.\n\nAbyssal Creator. A demon lord with dominionover undead laid waste to a mortal army and saw fit toexperiment on the abundance of corpses. Thus were madethe first ghouls. The demon lord crafted these ghouls to beundead shock troops smart enough to follow orders butnot enough to question them.\n\nBestial Nature. Contributing to their mentaldiminishment, ghouls have a never-ending desire to eatflesh. They carry none of their concerns from their formerlives, so their clothes are reduced to rags. The animalisticghouls hunt in packs, sniffing the air for prey and runningon their forelimbs and legs when chasing down theirvictims. They also proudly embrace the nauseating stenchthey emanate after they consume and revel in their kills.\n\nMedium Undead\n\nArmor Class 12\n\nHit Points 32\n\nSpeed 30 ft., climb 30 ft.\n\nStealth 14Immune charmed { Undead Resilience\n\nPerception 12\n\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Common\n\nSTR DEX CON INT Wis CHA+1 +2 +0 -2 +2 -2\n\nGhoul Hunger.

The creature has disadvantage on thissave if it consumed any amount of Humanoid flesh whilediseased. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a\n\nong rest after the disease is cured. The creature dies if this\n\neffect reduces its HP maximum to 0. If the infected creature\n\nails two of these saves or dies while infected, it becomes a\n\nghoul, or a ghast if its PB is +4 or higher, in a flesh-rending\n\nransformation. Only a wish spell or similarly powerful magiccan reverse the transformation. A creature that succeeds onwo saves recovers from the disease.\n\nHungry Dead Nature.

The consummate carnivoresenjoy the crunch of bones beneath their bloody clubs.\n\nBullies. While bugbears prefer to hunt and battle alone,they sometimes find themselves in leadership positionsover smaller goblins. Their command is marked by bouts ofterror, where they randomly inflict pain or humiliation ontheir subordinates. They don*t expect pushback from lessergoblins, but they back down from the rare, coordinatedresponse. This attitude persists when bugbears fight othercreatures. If assured of an easy win, they brutalize andtaunt their foes. However, they flee when their opponentsdemonstrate superiority on the battlefield, unless an evenmore powerful leader threatens their lives.\n\nSneaky Combatants. Owing to their cowardice,bugbears try to attack with the element of surprise and aredeadly against surprised enemies. They wait for cover ofdarkness or choose locations where they can hide. If theconditions arent right, they coerce their subordinates tocreate a distraction for them.\n\nBugbear CR1\n\nMedium Humanoid\n\nArmor Class 14 (hide armor)Hit Points 40Speed 30 ft.Perception 10 Stealth 16Senses darkvision 60 ft.\n\nLanguages Common, Goblin\n<PAGE>\nBrutal.

Fortunately, agoblin can find joy almost anywhere.\n\nCunning Over Strength. Goblin leaders are chosen fortheir intelligence and deviousness rather than strength atarms. Similarly, goblins value numbers over an individualsstrength, relying on each other to overwhelm powerful foes.\n\nNatural Spies. Many goblins parley their natural stealthinto careers. In urban environments, they excel in spycraft,information gathering, and thievery. In the wilderness,goblins are skillful scouts, trappers, and bandits.\n\nDelight in Thievery. Goblin culture considers stealing adelightful challenge. A goblin who cant guard a possessiondoesnt deserve it. Every goblin appreciates a good robbery,even if they are the victim. However, this peculiarity oftenleads to friction between goblins and other peoples.\n\nGoblin CR 1/4\n\nSmall Humanoid\n\nArmor Class 15 (leather armor, shield)Hit Points 12Speed 30 ft.Perception 9 Stealth 14Senses darkvision 60 ft.\n\nLanguages Common, Goblin\n\nSTR DEX CON INT wis CHA-1 +4 +0 +0 -1 -1ACTIONS\n\nScimitar.

The warriors yellow eyes seem to watcheverything.\n\nHobgoblins stand about as tall as a human, though theyare more powerfully built. As a society, most hobgoblinenclaves are highly organized military communities, calledcohorts, where members are ranked according to theirskills and accomplishments.\n\nRule Bound. The militant hobgoblins live their livesaccording to the Decrees, a complicated set of rules, laws,and customs. Tenets of the Decrees are so ingrained thateven hobgoblins who leave the community to becomeadventurers continue to model their reactions anddecisions on its lessons.\n\nThe Goblin Oath.

This movement for bothcreatures is unaffected by difficult terrain and doesntprovoke opportunity attacks.\n\nGRIMLOCK\n\nUttering a repetitive clicking sound, a rugged, human-likecreature shuffles forward, cocking its head to one side as if\n\nlistening intently. It has gray skin, stringy hair, and large,\n\nsightless red eyes.\n\nGrimlocks descend from the human population of a vastempire long ago lost to the underground in some forgottencalamity. Over generations, they adapted to the worldbelow ground, gradually losing their sight and evolvingnew senses.\n\nBlind Stewards. Xenophobic hunter-gatherers,\n\ngrimlocks retain some slight vestige of their ancestorsmighty empire in the form of complicated techno-\n\narcane devices. Grimlock shamans use complicated\n\noral traditions to pass down knowledge of how tomaintain these machines, though few grimlocks knowhow to construct them. This doesnt stop grimlocksfrom pocketing baubles cast off from these devices, andmany grimlocks have found the baubles to be effective atrepelling or disorienting intruders.\n\nEchosense. Grimlocks speak and understand thelanguage of the subterranean world, though they prefer tospeak their own dialect of Dwarvish. The clicking soundsthat form most of their words also serve as a form ofecholocation.\n\nSensitive Hearing. Relying on hearing and scent,grimlocks thrive in dark environments.

On a success, the target realizesthe gears growth was a magical, illusory effect and thatthe gear never increased in size.\n\nHARPY\n\nWith the body of a woman and the wings and talons of a swiftraptor, this monstrosity slashes the air as she dives at prey. Often,a barpy strikes with a deadly song on her lips.\n\nHarpies dwell in dark forests and along coastlines,building their eyries in high places to protect their young.Dangerous hunters with a taste for human and giant flesh,they lure prey to its doom using their magical voices ordescend upon it with talon and claw.\n\nAgents of the Divine. Though loathed now, harpieswere once the favored messengers of the gods until somenow-forgotten transgression exiled them from the divinerealms. Harpies claim they have no stories or legends ofthat time.\n\nClamor Eyries. Harpies live in large flocks of six to tenmated pairs and their children. A typical clamor is led bythe strongest hunters or most powerful singers.\n\nUrban Harpies. A few harpies have found acceptancein large urban centers.

Hit: 8 (2d6 + 1) thunder damage.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\n\nLuring Song. The harpy sings a magical melody. EveryHumanoid and Giant within 300 feet of the harpy that canhear the song must succeed on a DC 11 WIS save or becharmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonusaction on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It canstop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is\n\nincapacitated.\n\nWhile charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and\n\nignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is\n\nmore than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must moveon its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying\n\no get within 5 feet. It doesnt avoid opportunity attacks,\n\nbut before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a\n\npit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than\n\nhe harpy, the target can repeat the save. A charmed targetcan also repeat the save at the end of each of its turns. If\n\nhe save is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that\n\nsuccessfully saves is immune to this harpys song for the next\n\n24 hours.\n\nHELL HOUND\n\nBrimstone permeates the air around this hulking canine. Thebeasts claws are curved daggers, its eyes shine with a burningradiance, and flames curl out of its fanged mouth.\n\nHellhounds are fiends punished by their kin and forciblytransformed into the shape of a beast. They roam theinfernal realms in cruel packs or serve whatever mastersthey hope will restore them to original forms.\n\nInfernal Guardians. Hellhounds are often encounterednear sites important to evil creatures or demonicincursions. Greater demons give mortal supplicants theservice of hellhounds as a reward, though it also helps thedemon to watch over them.\n\nNo Mere Beast. Despite their shape and other bestialinstincts, hellhounds are still fiends, and they retain mostof their intellect and cruel cunning.

They are omnivorous butprefer meat. A single hippogriff considers an extremelywide swath as its hunting territory and remains in an areauntil the food supply is exhausted.\n\nEternal Mates. Hippogriffs mate for life, raising one totwo young ata time. They lay eggs, taking turns watchingover them (or hatchlings) while the other mate hunts forfood. When a hippogriff dies, its mate often starves itselfto death.\n\nLoyal Steeds. Hippogriff eggs are prized treasures andvaluable to everyone from elven lords to powerful humangenerals. A single egg is valued at 2,000 gp. Of all themonstrous mounts, hippogriffs are the easiest to train.However, the death of a hippogriffs rider sends the mountinto a frenzy.\n\nHippogriff CR1Large Monstrosity (Animal)\n\nArmor Class 11\n\nHit Points 44\n\nSpeed 40 ft., fly 60 ft.Perception 13 Stealth 10Resistant Monstrosity ResilienceSenses\n\nLanguages\n\nSTR DEX CON INT wis CHA\n\n+3 +1 +1 -4 +3 -1\n\nHeightened Sight.

They have redeyes and reptilian tails, and though only the size of gnomes, theyhold their weapons with easy familiarity.\n\nKobolds are diligent, hardworking creatures who view lifethrough a practical lens. They instinctively conform to thewishes of anyone stronger than themselves rather than riskconfrontation. Kobolds can be found in dark forests, deepunderground, and in the heart of urban centers.\n\nClever Miners. Skilled miners and inordinately cleverwith mechanical devices, kobolds routinely surround theirwarrens with traps, deadfalls, and camouflage.\n\nCollective Community. Kobolds share a strongcommunal instinct, knowing that only by acting togethercan they hope to defeat threats against them.

Then another eye opens, and another still. Withstartling speed, the barrel becomes a pseudopod-wielding horror,its toothy maw opening wide.\n\nThe dungeon delvers bane, a mimic is a stealthy predatorthat transforms itself into an inanimate object, perfectlycopying the appearance of wood or stone. It typically posesas furniture, doors, stairs, and the like. In its natural form,it resembles an amorphous blob with flesh-like protrusionsresembling objects it previously copied.\n\nDeceptive Hunters. While not terribly intelligent, mimicsare uncanny predators. They lurk in well trafficked areas ofdungeons, wildernesses, or urban environments, assumingshapes intended to lure prey. They then use their stickyadhesive skin to trap their next meal.\n\nTaste Focused. Mimics are supremely patient, but theyare obsessed with consuming prey to relish the taste, notnecessarily to sate hunger. The taste buds of a mimicstongue are extremely sensitive, and they gather a great dealof information with every bite.\n\nMedium Monstrosity (Shapechanger)Armor Class 12 (natural armor)\n\nHit Points 58Speed 20 ft.Perception 11 Stealth 13\n\nVulnerable cold\n\nResistant grappled ] Monstrosity ResilienceImmune acid ] proneSenses keensense 60 ft.\n\nLanguagesSTR DEX CON INT wis CHA\n\n+3 +1 +2 -3 +1 -1\n\nAdhesive (Object Form Only).

Anyequipment it is wearing or carrying isnt transformed. Itreverts to its true form if it dies.\n\nREACTIONS\n\nPrey Shield. When a creature the mimic can see hits it with anattack while it is grappling a creature, the mimic can roll thegrappled creature in front of the blow, forcing the grappledcreature to take the damage instead.\n\nMYCOLID\n\nThis small living fungus has the white fibrous stalk and soft,spongy head of a mushroom. Beneath its wide, bell-shaped cap,humanoid arms clutch ramshackle gardening instruments andcrude weapons, while flat leg-stalks move the plant-creaturetoward any potential threats.\n\nMycolids sprout in areas infused with unnatural magicalenergy, such as the fetid bog of a black dragon, thecavernous ruins of the underworld, or the shady gladeblessed by an archfey or druid. Regardless of region or\n<PAGE>\nclimate, commoner myconids spend most of their livescultivating a huge variety of mushrooms into a singleunbroken chain of interconnected growth.\n\nCommunity First. They thrive in harsh environmentswithout thought for shelter, culture, art, or history, andinstead pour every moment of their relatively short livesinto expanding the colony. Few creatures attack thepeaceful fungal folk, but those that do find their woodybodies, soft, springy heads, and immunity to pain difficultto overcome. When a colony is threatened, every commonermycolid fights to the death to protect the collective.\n\nHighly Toxic. Though commoner mycolids are safe tohandle, creatures foolish enough to eat one may succumb totheir potent toxins. In extreme situations, mycolids may letthemselves be eaten to kill massive or dangerous creaturesand add fertilizer to the colony. Mycolids spores are apowerful defense mechanism as well, and older mycolidshave more powerful spores. Even newborn commonermycolid spores can addle the mind of most beasts.\n\nShared Memory. Each mycolid is a clone ofa singleprogenitor called a spore lord. A family of like mycolids,the spawn of an individual spore lord, is called a ring,and each ring shares a collective pool of memories andconsciousness connected to a mycelial network. As such,mycolids remember their own births as though they tendedto their younger selves personally and can recall every birthand death since the ring began. Though all members ofaring look identical, no two rings are exactly alike. Separaterings cannot share thoughts or memories, but all mycolidscan communicate telepathically over short distances.\n\nSpore Lord. When a safe area of rich, damp fertilizercan be secured, a commoner mycolid may undergo arapid change into a more powerful form capable of usingits spores to create a near-endless supply of identicaloffspring. This form, called a spore lord, does not rule overother mycolids. But while commoners tend to the health ofmushrooms and mycolid sprouts, spore lords protect thecolony from threats and supply it with a stream of clones.A single spore lord might create dozens or hundreds ofclones of itself in its lifetime, and a dozen spore lords fromdifferent colonies may amass ina single fertile locationwithout conflict.\n\nMagic Channelers. Upon transformation, a spore lordis made larger, stronger, and smarter by the primal magicthat spawned it. Spore lords instinctively know how tomanipulate the environment through cultivation andmagic.\n\nCommunal Knowledge. All members of a spore lordsring share its memories, but commoners lack the capacityto understand how and why the spore lord is different,though they recognize it. Only when separated from thecolony can a commoner reach such an understanding,usually moments before it changes into a spore lord itself.\n\nMycolid Commoner CR 1/2\n\nSmall PlantArmor Class 12Hit Points 22Speed 15 ft.Perception 13 Stealth 14\n\nResistant poison { Plant Resilience\n\nSenses keensense 120 ft.

Aggressive, opportunistic warriors, orcsfollow the rule of might. In orcish culture, you are entitledto whatever you can take, for however long you are strongenough to hold it. Tribes choose homes based on the othercreatures that live nearby and what they have worth taking,even if those others are another orc tribe.\n\nGreat War Banners.

Its vast, toothy maw is largeenough to swallow a horse whole.\n\nTruly the rulers of their domains, purple worms claim theUnderworld as their hunting grounds. These tremendousmonsters can bore through solid rock, creating newtunnels and passageways as they travel. Any creature apurple worm encounters besides another of its kind is prey.\n\nFollow Prey by Sound. Purple worms are attractedby sound and vibration, leading most subterraneanhumanoids to travel as quietly as possible and ensure thatbattles are short and decisive. Major settlements in theUnderworld have contingencies in place for a purple wormattack.\n\nGemstones and Ore. A purple worm digests the earthand rock it ingests while tunneling, excreting it alongthe tunnels it creates and in the caverns where it rests.

Itwaves two large, feathery antennae about in a questing manner.\n\nAs its name implies, this odd creature can rust ferrousmetals, allowing it to eat the oxidized results. The rustmonster roams caves and tunnels seeking out such metals.When it finds it, the creature aggressively rushes to devourthe meal.

The things bony hands grip asword with malign intent.\n\nSkeletons are fleshless undead that have beenreconstructed and animated by fell magic. Soulless,emotionless, and driven by the whims of their master, theskeleton is an unshakable guardian. Skeletons can be foundin desecrated temples, graveyards, and cemeteries wherethey can watch, completely motionless, for eons. New andmasterful necromancers use skeletons as stalwart guardsand servants, though they understand such creatures haveno loyalty beyond the magic that controls them.\n\nDark Intelligence. While lacking humanoid intelligence,skeletons possess a cleverness that extends beyond a mere\n\nbeast or construct. Their malicious minds remember how towield weapons and armor, and they collect and use weaponsor shields taken from the recent dead. Skeletons look uponthe living with eyeless sockets and unsettling patience astheir instincts judge distances, tactics, and methods toseparate a potential targets flesh from their bones.\n\nMoldering Bodies. Though dried strands of tendon orwisps of stubborn hair may cling to a skeleton, magic aloneis responsible for its movement.

Humanoids can be infected by the fungusthrough contaminated food or water, breathing the sporeclouds, or the bite of an infected host.\n\nStages of Infection. Creatures infected by the apocalypticfungus go through different stages of infection beforethey ultimately expire. Most die before reaching the finalstage, though the fungus in their bodies continues to grow,dissolving the hosts remains. If the host body sustainsserious damage or can no longer move easily, the fungusattempts to move into a dark, sheltered area so that, asthe body decays, the fungus fruits and releases its spores.Sunlight kills the fungus and its spores.\n\nSkullblooms. Infected humanoids that succumb to thefungus become sporeborn skullblooms. Skullbloomsshow physical signs of their transformation, as the sporesinside the hosts brain sprout into spongy stalks thatbreak through the skull to crown the head, while patchesof fungus break through the cheeks and around the eye\n\nsockets and random areas of the body. Skullblooms stalkor ambush victims and use cooperative tactics, such asherding potential victims toward other skullblooms lyingin wait. Sometimes skullblooms enter periods of inertia,lying down or leaning up against a wall or tree and allowingthe fungus to spread over them, only to burst out andattack when a potential target passes by.\n\nBloatblossoms. Skullblooms eventually grow intobloatblossoms. A riot of fungal growth makes the body ofthese sporeborn broad and ungainly, with layers of tough,fibrous growth that protect it from damage. Bloatblossomshave better echolocation than the younger skullblooms, aswell as nodules filled with mycotoxins that they can tear\n\nfrom their bodies and hurl at targets.\n\nSkullbloom CR 1/2\n\nMedium Plant\n\nArmor Class 11 (natural armor)Hit Points 23Speed 30 ft.Perception 11 Stealth 12Resistant Plant ResilienceSenses keensense 10 ft.\n\nLanguages understands the languages it knew in life butcant speak\n\nSTR DEX CON INT wis CHA+2 +0 +2 -4 -1 -3\n\nHeightened Hearing.

Sprites travel through the forest inbands of six to one hundred. They mask their numbersusing their diminutive size and natural ability to turninvisible. Though sprites have been known to turn would-betrespassers away from their forest homes with traps, noises,or theatrical distractions, they are armed with arrows thatcan put creatures into a deep sleep. While their quarrysleeps, they may fetch a far more dangerous threat, retreat,or signal for reinforcements to dissuade further hostility.\n\nStern Protectors. Unlike many fey, sprites are serious,even-tempered, and intent on doing as little harm aspossible. Those they judge worthy might find themselvesprotected within the sprites territory, while those foundwanting could walk headlong into ambushes, traps, andenraged beasts.

As it approaches,its phosphorescent glow slowly dims into blackness. Seconds later,the thing erupts with a blinding flash.\n\nStar crows are tiny, formless alien beings that lacksentience or emotion. These glowing creatures are drawnto sentient beings, feeding ravenously on the beingsthoughts. They have also been known to carry and transfermemories of one sentient creature to another. Star crowstransmit these thoughts as a powerful illusory experience,a pastiche of raw emotion, color, images, and sounds.Some star crows bear the wisdom of primordial beings,while others deliver incomprehensible knowledge.\n\nImmortal. Star crows have an infinite lifespan. They donot age and do not require food, water, air, or rest. Thememories each star crow carries degrade, combine, orinterlace with the eons of visions a single star crow maypossess.

Worgs often shelter in warrens,tunnels, and caves in which they can travel quickly to preyand away from predators. Such places are fetid, vile placesfull of half-eaten corpses that the worg seems to havegorged itself on without consequence.\n\nWilling Mounts. While many beasts of burden mustbe trained to hold a rider, worgs tend to willingly carrygoblins, who share a great number of similarities to theworg, and use the smaller creatures to find more bountifulhumanoid prey.

Sometimes an enduring sourceof necromantic magic corrupts an area, causing nearbycorpses to spontaneously rise as zombies.\n\nDecayed Corpses. The appearance of zombies varieswidely, depending upon the condition of the corpse priorto animation. A corpse dead from natural causes and stolenfrom an undertaker may be well-preserved, if obviously notalive, while a zombie animated from a drowning victim isbloated and sagging. Some necromancers use whatever isat hand. Others may choose the most disgusting corpsesto add an additional fear factor for those that must face thezombies in combat.\n\nDim Intellect. Zombies have no personality and littleintellect, following only the most basic commands. Theycan wield weapons if armed but simply batter an opponentwith its limbs if not. They do not have the intellect to avoideven obvious hazards, shambling into open pits if they existbetween them and a target or walking heedlessly througha fire to attack, unless commanded otherwise in thatmoment. When not under specific orders, a zombie simplystands awaiting commands, though ifa living creaturecomes close enough for it to detect, it attacks, as the darkmagics animating a zombie make it malicious toward theliving.\n\nNon-Human Zombies. Zombies are most commonlyanimated human remains, but the flesh of any living thingcan be animated as a zombie. Zombie giants, for example,would be stronger and harder to kill than a human zombie.They would attack like other zombies, though they couldthrow rocks like a living giant if commanded to do so. Non-humanoid zombies typically attack as they did when living.A zombie dragon, for example, would attack with clawsand teeth, and it could still fly if its wings were intact.\n\nMedium UndeadArmor Class 8Hit Points 16Speed 20 ft.Perception 10 Stealth 8\n\nImmune Undead Resilience\n\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\n\nLanguages understands the languages it knew in life butcant speak\n\nUndead Fortitude. \\f damage reduces the zombie to 0 HP. itmust make a CON save with a DC equal to 5 + the damagetaken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit.

Each answer should be a complete sentence. Only use information that is in the excerpt this is an EXCERPT from my book.##### EXCERPT:\nHEAVY ARMOR\n\nHeavy armor provides the most protection of any armortype, but wearing it demands great physical prowess.Fighters are one of the few character classes that can takefull advantage of heavy armors defensive capabilities.\n\nSHIELDS\n\nShields are a unique type of armor because they are heldinstead of worn. This means you can lose their AC bonusif the shield is destroyed or dropped. Wielding a shieldrequires the use of one hand, which means a PC cant usetwo-handed weapons while holding a shield. You can onlybenefit from one shield AC bonus at a time, even whileholding multiple shields.\n\nARMOR PROPERTIES\n\nCertain sets of armor have properties that affect how theyare used, as shown in the Properties column of the Armortable.\n\nCumbersome. This armor is heavy and difficult to move inunless you possess the required STR. Ifa player characterdoes not have a STR score equal to or greater than theSTRscore listed in parentheses, their movement speed isreduced by io feet while they wear the armor, even if theyare proficient with it.\n\nNatural Materials. This armor does not interfere with adruids ability to cast spells. At GMs discretion, a shieldcan have this property.\n\nNoisy. This armor imposes disadvantage on any abilitychecks made to avoid notice, like sneaking, hiding, orotherwise attempting to move silently.\n\nGETTING INTO AND OUT OF ARMOR\n\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on thearmors category.\n\nDon. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefitfrom the armors AC only if you take the full time to donthe suit of armor.\n\nDoff. This is the time it takes to remove armor. If you havehelp, reduce this time by half.\n\nDONNING AND DOFFING ARMOR\n\nCATEGORY DON DOFFLight Armor 1 minute 1 minuteMedium Armor 5 minutes 1 minuteHeavy Armor 10 minutes 5 minutesShield 1 action 1 action\n\nPC Wisdom: Casting spells with somatic componentsrequires at least one free hand. Unless you have afeature that allows you to work around this (such\n\nas the Combat Caster talent), your spellcastingcapabilities suffer while you hold both a weapon anda shield.\n\nARMORARMOR COST AC BONUS WEIGHT PROPERTIESLight ArmorLeather 10 gp 1 + DEX modifier 10 Ib.

I'm making a FAQ please create 20 questions that a player may ask and the answers for them based on the excerpt. each question should also have a C line for the heading that the information is in please use raw text only do not use any markdown code. Each answer should be a complete sentence. Only use information that is in the excerpt this is an EXCERPT from my book.##### EXCERPT:\nWEAPONS\n\nThe Weapons table lists the cost, damage dice and type,weight, weapon options, and special properties forcommon weapons. The table is also split by proficienciesrequired (simple and martial) to successfully wield thevarious weapons.\n\nWEAPON TYPES & PROFICIENCIES\n\nEach weapon is categorized into a type associated with aproficiency. For instance, a character with proficiency inmartial weapons gets to add their PB to attack rolls madewith any weapon listed in the martial weapons section ofthe Weapons table.\n\nAny character can wield any weapon, but only a characterwith proficiency can add their PB to attack rolls with thoseweapons.\n\nMELEE WEAPONSMelee weapons are used to attack nearby targets (typicallywithin 5 feet).\n\nRANGED WEAPONSRanged weapons are used to attack targets at a distance.\n\nSIMPLE WEAPONS\n\nSimple weapons require little experience to use effectively.These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weaponsoften found in the hands of commoners.\n\nMARTIAL WEAPONS\n\nMartial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms,require more specialized training to use effectively. Mostwarriors use martial weapons because these weapons tendto deal more damage and put their training to best use.\n\nIMPROVISED WEAPONS\n\nSometimes characters dont have their favorite weaponsand must fight with whatevers handy. An improvisedweapon includes any object you can wield in one or twohands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, awagon wheel, or a dead goblin.\n\nWhen in doubt about how much damage an object shoulddeal, find a weapon on the Weapons table most like theobject and use its damage die. For example, a table leg is a\n\nWEAPON OPTIONS\n\nThis section offers unique options for using weapons inways other than dealing damage, giving different weaponsdistinct impacts on the battlefield, as shown in theWeapons table.\n\nAcharacter can use a weapon option only if the characteris wielding and proficient with a weapon. If an optionrequires a creature to make an ability check or save, the DCequals 8 + the attackers PB + the attackers STR or DEXmodifier (attackers choice).\n\nUnless specified otherwise, a weapon used to performa weapon option has only the options listed effect anddoesnt deal normal weapon damage. If a weapon optioninstructs a character to make and attack with the weapon,and the character can make multiple attacks with theAttack action, the weapon option replaces only one ofthose attacks.\n\nAt the GMs discretion, some weapon options mightnot work against certain creatures. For example, the tripweapon option might not work against a creature withoutdiscernable legs, such as an ooze, or that is anchored orattached to the ground in some way, such as a tree withanimated limbs.\n\nBASH\n\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can hitthe target in the side of the head or other vital organ,disorienting it fora moment. Make an attack roll with thisweapon. Ona hit, the target is briefly disoriented and hasdisadvantage on its next attack roll.\n\nDISARM\n\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you canchoose to aim a jarring hit at the targets held weapon,knocking it from their grasp. Make an attack roll with thisweapon. Ona hit, the target must succeed ona STRorDEX save (targets choice) or drop its weapon, which landsin an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If no unoccupiedspace is within range, the weapon lands at the targets feet.\n\nlot like a club. At the GMs discretion, a character proficientwith a weapon can use a similar object as if it were thatweapon and add their PB as normal.\n\nIf a character uses a ranged weapon to make a meleeattack or throws a melee weapon that does not have thethrown property, those are considered improvised weapons,and typically deal 1d4 damage of an appropriate damagetype. An improvised thrown weapon typically has range of20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

Make anattack roll with this weapon. Ona hit, the target is pulledup to 5 feet closer to you. If this movement would pull acreature into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, it canmake a STR or DEX (targets choice) save, avoiding thepull ona success.\n\nRICOCHET SHOT\n\nAs an action, you can ricochet an attack off an object\n\nor structure to hit a target you can see that has half orthree-quarters cover. The target must be within 10 feet ofan object or structure that isnt providing it with cover,and that object or structure must be within your weaponsnormal range. Make an attack roll with this weaponagainst the targets AC as if it werent behind cover. Onahit, the target takes damage as if hit by your attack. Thisweapon option expends the same ammunition as a normalattack with this weapon.

The target must succeed on a STR or DEX save(targets choice) or fall prone. If the target is mounted, ithas advantage on the save.\n\nWEAPON PROPERTIES\n\nMany weapons have special properties related to their use,as shown in the Weapons table.\n\nAmmunition. You can use a weapon that has theammunition property to make a ranged attack only if youhave ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each timeyou attack with the weapon, you expend one piece ofammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver,case, or other container is part of the attack (you needa free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the endof an encounter, you can recover half your expendedammunition by taking 1 minute to search the battlefield.\n\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property tomake a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvisedweapon (see Improvised Weapons sidebar). A sling must beloaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\n\nFinesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon,use your choice of your STRor DEX modifier for theattack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifierfor both rolls.\n\nHeavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rollswith heavy weapons. A heavy weapons size and bulk makeit too large for a Small creature to use effectively.\n\nLight. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, makingit ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.\n\nLoading. Because of the time required to load thisweapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from itwhen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it,regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\n\nRange. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attackhas a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrownproperty. The range lists two numbers. The first is theweapons normal range in feet, and the second indicatesthe weapons long range. When attacking a target beyondnormal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. Youcant attack a target beyond the weapons long range.\n\nReach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when youattack with it, as well as when determining your reach foropportunity attacks with it.\n\nThrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you canthrow it to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a meleeweapon, use the same ability modifier for that attack rolland damage roll that you would use for a melee attack withthe weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, use yourSTR, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your STRor your DEX, since the dagger has the finesse property.\n\nTwo-Handed. This weapon requires you to use two handswhen you attack with it.\n\nVersatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands.These weapons have two damage values listed. The higherdamage value is used when you use two hands to make amelee attack.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book. I'm making a FAQ please create 20 questions that a player may ask and the answers for them based on the excerpt. each question should also have a C line for the heading that the information is in please use raw text only do not use any markdown code.

The Mounts table showseach animals speed and base carrying capacity.\n\nAn animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagoncan move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity,including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pullthe same vehicle, add their carrying capacity together.\n\nMounts other than those listed here are available infantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normallyavailable for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi,griftons, hippogrifts, and similar animals) and even aquaticmounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring sucha mount often means securing an egg and raising thecreature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity,or negotiating with the mount itself.\n\nVehicle Proficiency.

Each answer should be a complete sentence. Only use information that is in the excerpt this is an EXCERPT from my book.##### EXCERPT:\nSERVICES\n\nAdventurers can pay NPCs to assist them or act on theirbehalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelingshave fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of\n\na craft or art, and a few are experts with specializedadventuring skills.\n\nSome basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table.Other common hirelings include any of the wide varietyof people who inhabit a typical town or city and whom theadventurers pay to perform a specific task. For example,\n\na wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaboratechest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chestspell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge aspecial sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisiteclothing for an upcoming performance for the duke.\n\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerousservices. Mercenary soldiers paid to help take onahobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired toresearch ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurerestablishes a stronghold of some kind, they might hire awhole staff of servants and agents to run the place, froma castellan or steward all the way down to stable cleaners.These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract thatincludes a place to live within the stronghold as part of thecompensation.\n\nSkilled hirelings include anyone employed to performa service that involves a proficiency (including weapon,tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. Thepay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings requiremore pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial workthat requires no particular skill and can include laborers,porters, maids, and similar workers.\n\nMAGIC ITEMS\n\nOf the many rewards available to adventurers, magic itemsare perhaps the most coveted. These powerful objects arecreated using raw magic and are incredibly complicated toproduce. Few beings in the world possess the knowledgeto make magic items, which makes them hard to find andvaluable.\n\nThe GM is the ultimate arbiter of where magic itemsappear, but they are often given as rewards for crawlingthrough deadly dungeons or slaying the creatures thatguard them.\n\nUSING A MAGIC ITEM\n\nUsing a magic items properties might mean wearing\n\nor wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must bedonned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet,gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, andrings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield\n\nstrapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders.Aweapon must be held.\n\nIn most cases, a magic item thats meant to be worncan fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magicgarments are made to be easily adjustable, or theymagically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptionsexist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fitonly creatures of a certain size or shape, the GM can rulethat it doesnt adjust.\n\nWhen a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, it is upto GM discretion as to whether the item functions asintended. A ring placed ona tentacle might work, but aserpentfolk with a tail instead of legs cant wear boots.\n\nMULTIPLE ITEMS OF THE SAME KIND\n\nUse common sense to determine whether more than oneof a given kind of magic item can be worn. A charactercant normally wear more than one pair of footwear, onepair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit\n\nof armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You canmake exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circletunder a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks.\n\nPAIRED ITEMS\n\nItems that come in pairssuch as boots, bracers,gauntlets, and glovesimpart their benefits only if bothitems of the pair are worn. For example, a characterwearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a bootof elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either.\n\nATTUNEMENT\n\nSome magic items require a creature to form a bondwith them before their magical properties can be used.This bond is called attunement, and certain items haveaprerequisite for attunement. If the prerequisite is a class,a creature must be a member of that class to attune to theitem. If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creaturequalifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits orfeatures, not from using a magic item or the like.\n\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requiresattunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits,unless its description states otherwise. For example, amagic shield that requires attunement provides the benefitsof anormal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but noneof its magical properties.\n\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend a shortrest focused on only that item while being in physicalcontact with it. This focus can take the form of weaponpractice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item),or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest isinterrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, atthe end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitiveunderstanding of how to activate any magical properties ofthe item, including any necessary command words.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book. I'm making a FAQ please create 20 questions that a player may ask and the answers for them based on the excerpt. each question should also have a C line for the heading that the information is in please use raw text only do not use any markdown code. Each answer should be a complete sentence. Only use information that is in the excerpt this is an EXCERPT from my book.##### EXCERPT:\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time,and a creature can be attuned to no more than a numberof items equal to its proficiency bonus (PB) at any onetime. Any attempt to attune to an additional item fails;the creature must end its attunement to an item first.Additionally, a creature cant attune to more than one copyof an item. For example, a creature cant attune to morethan one ring of protection at a time.\n\nAcreatures attunement to an item ends if the creatureno longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, ifthe item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes tothe item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunementby spending another short rest focused on the item, unlessthe item is cursed.\n\nACTIVATING AN ITEM\n\nActivating some magic items requires a user to dosomething special, such as holding the item and utteringa command word. The description of an item category orindividual item details how an item is activated. Certainitems use the following rules for their activation.\n\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isnt afunction of the Use an Item action.\n\nCOMMAND WORD\n\nAcommand word is a word or phrase that must be\n\nspoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires acommand word cant be activated in an area where sound isprevented, as in the area of the silence spell.\n\nSPELLS\n\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from theitem. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell ring,doesnt expend any of the users spell slots, and requires nocomponents, unless the items description says otherwise.The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration,and the user of the item must concentrate if the spellrequires concentration. Many items, such as potions,bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spells effectswith their usual duration. Certain items make exceptionsto these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or otherparts ofa spell.\n\nA magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you touse your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell fromthe item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, youchoose which one to use with the item. If you dont have aspellcasting ability, your spellcasting ability modifier is +0for the item, and your PB does apply.\n\nCHARGES\n\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended toactivate their properties. The number of charges an item\n\nhas remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it,as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, whenan item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learnshow many charges it regained.\n\nMAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS\n\nThis section lists some magic items found within theknown universe. Each entry provides key informationabout the item, including its rarity category, whether or notit requires attunement to use, its price, and a description ofits properties.\n\nAmmunition, +1, +2, or +3\n\nWeapon (Any Ammunition), Rarity VariesPrice Varies\n\nYou have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made withthis piece of magic ammunition.

Magic is themanipulation of those energies to change reality. Thosewho can harness such energies are called spellcasters.\n\nSpellcasters are categorized into groups based on thesource of their power. Regardless of sources, the laws thatrule these reality-shaping effects, known as spells, are thesame. This section outlines the rules of spellcasting andincludes a selection of commonly seen spells.\n\nWHAT IS A SPELL?\n\nA spell is a manipulation of reality accomplished using\n\na combination of will and energy. Every spell must haveenergy to fuel its effects and a spellcaster capable ofcontrolling the flow of energy. Spells can accomplish anynumber of thingsharm, protection, problem-solvingall guided by a casters imagination.\n\nCreating a new spell is a work of extreme creativity andintense effort, often resulting from a lifetime of study.Because of this, most casters choose their spells fromestablished pools of knowledge.\n\nCIRCLES OF MAGIC\n\nCircles of magic represent primary sources that fuelspellcaster abilities. This section details two circles of magic,arcane and divine, and explains their roles in spellcasting.\n\nARCANE CIRCLE\n\nThe arcane circle draws its power from manipulatingmeasurable forces that govern material reality. Thisincludes forces like heat, space, and gravity. An arcanecaster uses a precise combination of words, gestures, andmaterials to ignite a roaring flame or link two locationshundreds of miles apart.\n\nArcane magic is governed by an extensive set of rulesand calculations, which a caster uses to enact effects. Itcan resemble a science more than mystical workings.Harnessing magic from this circle requires creativity,precision, and a drive for perfection.\n\nThe tools of arcane magic are varied and often highlypersonal to the caster. Common tools include runes,recitations, and hand gestures.\n\nConversion from 5th Edition. When converting fifthedition spells into circles of magic, these qualities indicatethat a spell might be arcane:\n\nâ€¢ The spell detects, suppresses, ends, or otherwise\n\ninteracts with mechanical aspects of spellcasting.\n\nâ€¢ The spell harnesses elemental energy (acid, cold, fire,\n\nlightning, or thunder).\n\nâ€¢ The spell interacts with the five senses, whether to foolthem or to extend their capabilities.\n\nDIVINE CIRCLE\n\nThe divine circle draws its power from the connectivitybetween beings. A divine caster can imbue a dying creaturewith the will to live, channel the wrath of a god into a firestorm, or restore withered crops to a starving community.\n\nDivine magic requires a connection between the casterand at least one other being to function. Harnessing magicfrom this circle requires devotion, awareness of others, andbelief in improving the world for those served.\n\nThe common model for divine magic frames it withinreligious faith, where an individual enacts the will of a god.However, the divine circle is also accessible to a caster whoacts out of devotion to a particular community, an evilpact set forth by a cult, or any similarly compelling source.Wherever need exists, there is the potential for divinemagic.\n\nConversion from 5th Edition. When converting fifthedition spells into circles of magic, these qualities indicatethat a spell might be divine:\n\nâ€¢ The spell specifically interacts with another creatureslife force, whether to heal or harm.\n\nâ€¢ The spell harnesses radiant or necrotic energy.\n\nâ€¢ The spell specifies interaction with a deity or includesthe word faith in the description.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book. I'm making a FAQ please create 20 questions that a player may ask and the answers for them based on the excerpt. each question should also have a C line for the heading that the information is in please use raw text only do not use any markdown code. Each answer should be a complete sentence. Only use information that is in the excerpt this is an EXCERPT from my book.##### EXCERPT:\nSPELL RINGS\n\nEvery spell is categorized into a ring, ranked from Ist tooth. Higher rings require more energy to fuel the spell andhave stronger effects.\n\nLike the rings within a tree trunk, rings of magic encircleone another. A novice spellcaster starts at the center of thecircle with access to the Ist ring. As they grow in ability,their powers expand toward the circles edge, giving accessto more rings. The further a ring is from the center, thehigher level a spellcaster must be to use that rings spells.\n\nEach class provides a table of what spellcaster level youmust achieve before you gain access to new spell rings.Typically, a spellcaster must be at least 17th level beforethey can cast spells from the 9th and final ring.\n\nSPELL SLOTS\n\nSpell slots are a measure of the energy a caster has tofuel their spells. Check the progression table for yourspellcasting class to see how many spell slots your characterhas at a given level. As you gain levels, you gain new slots tocast spells from higher rings and more slots for spells fromlower rings.\n\nAcaster who has used all their spell slots is spent,physically and mentally. Theyre out of energy for spells.To replenish spell slots, you must complete a short or longresteach class specifies which type of rest and how manyslots you regain. This rest represents the time needed torecover from the toll spellcasting takes on the body andmind.\n\nSCHOOLS OF MAGIC\n\nPractitioners and sages have attempted to quantify andcategorize the complexities of magic into eight universallyrecognized categories known as spell schools. Theseschools have no inherent influence ona spell, but they helpidentify a spells effect. Specific class features or characterabilities may refer to these schools. The eight schools arebroadly explained in this section.\n\nABJURATION\n\nAbjuration spells use wards, shields, and other means ofdeflection to defend their target. Such spells might looklike creating a force shield to block incoming missiles orimbuing a homestead with a ward to deter unwanted pests.\n\nCONJURATION\n\nConjuration spells restructure space, enabling objects,creatures, and other targets to be transported from place toplace. Such spells might look like causing a lost house keyto appear in your hand or creating a portal that allows forinstantaneous travel to a far-flung realm of existence.\n\nDIVINATION\n\nDivination spells collect information, allowing a user toglean locations, outcomes, or sensory feedback beyond thelimitations of standard perception. Such spells might looklike sensing the location of a hidden entrance or receiving avision of future events.\n\nENCHANTMENTEnchantment spells influence the minds of creatures,allowing a user to manipulate emotions or behavior.\n\nEVOCATION\n\nEvocation spells shape energy, allowing a user to channelhealing, change air into roaring flame, or stir the skies intoa raging storm.\n\nILLUSIONIllusion spells deceive the senses, allowing a user to maskor alter the truth and create objects that seem real.\n\nNECROMANCYNecromancy spells manipulate life, allowing a user to useanothers life force to heal or reanimate the dead.\n\nTRANSMUTATION\n\nTransmutation spells alter the forms of creatures orobjects, allowing a user to turn lead into gold or transforman enemy into a toad.\n\nKNOWN SPELLS\n\nA spellcaster must be extremely familiar with a spell orpossess a magic item imbued with the spell to cast it. Eachspellcasting class solves this familiarity issue differently.\n\nFor example, a wizard catalogs their known spells inaspellbook and adds to it whenever they discover a new spell.Your character class defines how many spells you know andcan potentially learn as you gain more class levels.\n\nPREPARED SPELLS\n\nA prepared spell is ready to cast quickly, in the heat ofbattle, without extensive reading or setup. Due to theintense mental fortitude necessary, the number of spells acaster can prepare at one time is generally limited.\n\nSome spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, mustprepare all their spells ahead of time through study ormeditation. Different spellcasting classes with shorterknown spell lists can automatically prepare all their knownspells.\n\nYour character class defines what you must do to preparespells and how many spells you can have prepared at anygiven level.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

Each answer should be a complete sentence.

A cantrip can be cast without using a spell slotand without being prepared. Repeated practice has fixedthe spell in the casters mind and infused the caster with theenergy needed to produce the effect on demand. A cantripsspell ring is o.\n\nYour class defines whether you can access cantrips, andhow many cantrips you knowat each class level.\n\nRITUALS\n\nRitual spells are uniquely powerful magic that takes 1minute or longer to cast and often requires costly materialcomponents. A caster can only learn ritual spells associatedwith their circle of magic.\n\nRitual spells dont use spell slots. Otherwise, ritual spellsfollow normal spellcasting rules.\n\nYour character class defines whether you can access ritualspells, and how many rituals you know at each class level.\n\nCASTING IN ARMOR\n\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures requiredfor spellcasting, you must be proficient with any armor youare wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distractedand hampered for spellcasting.\n\nCOMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS\n\nThe effects of different spells combine while the durationsof those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell castmultiple times dont combine, however. Instead, the mostpotent effect, such as the highest bonus from multiplecastings, applies while their durations overlap.\n\nFor example, if two wizards cast mage armor on the sametarget, that target gains the spells benefit only once; theydont get multiple AC bonuses.\n\nELEMENTS OF A SPELL\n\nWhen a character casts a spell, the basic rules are the sameregardless of the spell ring or its circle.\n\nEach spell in this chapter includes basic information,including the spells name, ring, circle, school, castingtime, range, required components, and duration. Everyspell also contains a description of its effect.\n\nCASTING TIME\n\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some can beaccomplished in a shorter or longer span.\n\nA spell cast with a bonus action is fast. You must use abonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided youhavent already taken a bonus action this turn. If you useyour bonus action to cast a spell from the Ist ring or higheron your turn, you cant also use your action to cast a spellfrom the Ist ring or higher during the same turn.\n\nREACTION\n\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take\n\na fraction ofa second to bring about and are cast inresponse to specific triggering events. Ifa spell can be castas a reaction, the spell description specifies the triggerrequired.\n\nLONGER CASTING TIMES\n\nCertain spells (particularly rituals) require more time tocast, minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with\n\na casting time longer than a single action or reaction,\n\nyou must spend your action each turn casting, and\n\nyou must maintain concentration while you do so (seeConcentration). If your concentration is broken, the spellfails, but the attempt doesnt use a spell slot. To try castingthe spell again, you must start over.\n\nRANGE\n\nThe target of a spell must be within the spells range. Fora spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. Fora spelllike fireball, the target is a point in space where the ball offire erupts.\n\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells cantarget only a creature (including you) that you touch. Otherspells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spellshavea range of self.\n\nSpells that appear in cones or lines that originate fromyou also have a range of self, indicating that the originpoint must be you (see Area of Effect).\n\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects arent limited by its rangeunless the spells description says otherwise.\n\nAREA OF EFFECT\n\nSpells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area,allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n\nA spells description specifies its area of effect, whichtypically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point oforigin, a location from which the spells energy erupts. Thetules for each shape specify how you position its origin.Usually, the origin is a point in space that you choosewithin the spells range, but some spells originate from acreature or an object.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

Each spells description indicateswhether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M)components. If you cant provide one or more of a spellscomponents, you cant cast the spell.\n\nVERBAL (V)\n\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. Thecombination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance,sets the magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gaggedor in an area of silence, such as one created by the silencespell, cant cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\nSOMATIC (S)\n\nSpellcasting might include a forceful gesticulation oran intricate set of motions. Ifa spell requires a somaticcomponent, the caster must have free use of at least onehand to perform these gestures.\n\nMATERIAL (M)\n\nCasting some spells requires specific objects detailed\n\nin parentheses in the component entry. A character canuse a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found inEquipment) in place of the components specified for aspell. However, ifa cost is indicated for a component, apouch or focus cant substitute for it. The character musthave that specific component to cast the spell.\n\nIfa spell states that a material component is consumed bythe spell, the caster must provide this component for eachcasting of the spell.\n\nA spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spellsmaterial componentsor to hold a spellcasting focusbut it can be the same hand that they use to performsomatic components.\n\nDURATION\n\nA spells duration is the length of time the spell persists.A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, or evenyears. Some spells specify that their effects last until thespells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\nINSTANTANEOUS\n\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals,creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that cantbe dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\nSome spells require concentration to keep the magic active.If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that factappears in its duration entry, and it specifies how long youcan concentrate on it. You can end concentration at anytime (no action required).\n\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesntinterfere with concentration. The following factors canbreak concentration:\n\nâ€¢ Casting another spell that requires concentration.You lose concentration ona spell if you cast anotherspell that requires concentration.

You can seem I foot shorter or taller and canappear thin, fat, or in between. You cant change your bodytype, so you must adopt a form that has the same basicarrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusionis up to you.\n\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up tophysical inspection. For example, if you use this spell toadd a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, andanyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feelyour head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinnerthan you are, the hand of someone who reaches out totouch you would bump into you while it was seemingly stillin midair.\n\nTo discern that you are disguised, a creature can use itsaction to inspect your appearance and must succeed on anINT (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\n\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Abjuration)\n\nCasting Time: 1 action\n\nRange: 120 feet\n\nComponents: V, S\n\nDuration: Instantaneous\n\nYou break a spells power, ending its effects.\n\nChoose one creature, object, or magical effect withinrange.

The bladeis similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts forthe duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but\n\nyou can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. When theblade appears, you decide whether it deals acid, cold, fire,lightning, or thunder damage.\n\nYou can use your action to make a melee spell attack withthe elemental blade.

The targets size doubles in all dimensions, andits weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increasesits size by one category from Medium to Large, forexample. Ifthere isnt enough room for the target todouble its size, the creature or object attains the maximumpossible size in the space available.

The GM can use Doom\n\nto influence the results of creature die rolls, turning thetide on the player characters (PC) or helping a creaturelast just one turn longer. The GM can spend Doom in thefollowing ways:\n\nâ€¢ Give a creature advantage on an attack rollâ€¢ Give a PC disadvantage on a save\n\nâ€¢ Once per encounter, refresh, recharge, or otherwisegain one additional use of a limited-use feature,such as a dragons Breath Weapon, a legendarycreatures Legendary Resistance, or a spell in a magesSpellcasting.\n\nDoom is optional and exists to give creatures some extra\n\nstaying power against particularly powerful, crafty, or\n\nresourceful PCs. Keep in mind, Doom doesnt have to be\n\nused in every combat encounter. As a GM, consider using\n\nDoom in an encounter if:\n\nâ€¢ The combat encounter is likely the only combat\n\nencounter the PCs will face that day, and the PCs arewell-rested.\n\nâ€¢ You have multiple experienced players.â€¢ You have more than four players.\n\nâ€¢ Your players characters have extra magic items,resources, optimized statistics, or similar aspects thatmake them tougher than average PCs.\n\nâ€¢ Ifthe encounter is particularly significant to the story,such as the fight against the leader of an antagonisticorganization working against the PCs, the final fight ofa major story arc, or a climactic fight against a powerfulantagonist.\n\nDOOM BY ENCOUNTER TIER0-45-89-1213-1617-2021+\n\nHDym;~R][W)rmo]\n\nHow 70 USE THESE MONSTERS\n\nRules for understanding the statistics of monsters (oftencalled Wcreatures) are described in this chapter. If youre aGame Master (GM), look this over and familiarize yourselfwith the elements of a creature and its statistics beforeusing a creature in your game.\n\nDescription and Lore. Each creature entry includesan italicized description of it as well as lore describingthe creatures origins, typical motives, and similar. Theitalicized description at the top of each entry is written as ifthe player characters (PCs) just stumbled upon the creatureand often can be read aloud to your players when theircharacters first encounter the creature.\n\nELEMENTS OF A STAT BLOCK\n\nThe information you need to use a creature in your game\n\nis organized into an easy-reference format called a statblock. This section describes the meaning of the terms inastat block and the contents of each heading within the statblock. Note that each creatures stat block has been writtenand organized with an eye toward making creatures fasterand easier to use during your game, including displayingthe precalculated results for ability checks, damage, abilityscores, and other calculations.\n\n#####END#####\n"

This means you can lose their AC bonusif the shield is destroyed or dropped. Wielding a shieldrequires the use of one hand, which means a PC cant usetwo-handed weapons while holding a shield. You can onlybenefit from one shield AC bonus at a time, even whileholding multiple shields.\n\nARMOR PROPERTIES\n\nCertain sets of armor have properties that affect how theyare used, as shown in the Properties column of the Armortable.\n\nCumbersome. This armor is heavy and difficult to move inunless you possess the required STR. Ifa player characterdoes not have a STR score equal to or greater than theSTRscore listed in parentheses, their movement speed isreduced by io feet while they wear the armor, even if theyare proficient with it.\n\nNatural Materials. This armor does not interfere with adruids ability to cast spells. At GMs discretion, a shieldcan have this property.\n\nNoisy. This armor imposes disadvantage on any abilitychecks made to avoid notice, like sneaking, hiding, orotherwise attempting to move silently.\n\nGETTING INTO AND OUT OF ARMOR\n\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on thearmors category.\n\nDon. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefitfrom the armors AC only if you take the full time to donthe suit of armor.\n\nDoff. This is the time it takes to remove armor. If you havehelp, reduce this time by half.\n\nDONNING AND DOFFING ARMOR\n\nCATEGORY DON DOFFLight Armor 1 minute 1 minuteMedium Armor 5 minutes 1 minuteHeavy Armor 10 minutes 5 minutesShield 1 action 1 action\n\nPC Wisdom: Casting spells with somatic componentsrequires at least one free hand. Unless you have afeature that allows you to work around this (such\n\nas the Combat Caster talent), your spellcastingcapabilities suffer while you hold both a weapon anda shield.\n\nARMORARMOR COST AC BONUS WEIGHT PROPERTIESLight ArmorLeather 10 gp 1 + DEX modifier 10 Ib.

The table is also split by proficienciesrequired (simple and martial) to successfully wield thevarious weapons.\n\nWEAPON TYPES & PROFICIENCIES\n\nEach weapon is categorized into a type associated with aproficiency. For instance, a character with proficiency inmartial weapons gets to add their PB to attack rolls madewith any weapon listed in the martial weapons section ofthe Weapons table.\n\nAny character can wield any weapon, but only a characterwith proficiency can add their PB to attack rolls with thoseweapons.\n\nMELEE WEAPONSMelee weapons are used to attack nearby targets (typicallywithin 5 feet).\n\nRANGED WEAPONSRanged weapons are used to attack targets at a distance.\n\nSIMPLE WEAPONS\n\nSimple weapons require little experience to use effectively.These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weaponsoften found in the hands of commoners.\n\nMARTIAL WEAPONS\n\nMartial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms,require more specialized training to use effectively. Mostwarriors use martial weapons because these weapons tendto deal more damage and put their training to best use.\n\nIMPROVISED WEAPONS\n\nSometimes characters dont have their favorite weaponsand must fight with whatevers handy. An improvisedweapon includes any object you can wield in one or twohands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, awagon wheel, or a dead goblin.\n\nWhen in doubt about how much damage an object shoulddeal, find a weapon on the Weapons table most like theobject and use its damage die. For example, a table leg is a\n\nWEAPON OPTIONS\n\nThis section offers unique options for using weapons inways other than dealing damage, giving different weaponsdistinct impacts on the battlefield, as shown in theWeapons table.\n\nAcharacter can use a weapon option only if the characteris wielding and proficient with a weapon. If an optionrequires a creature to make an ability check or save, the DCequals 8 + the attackers PB + the attackers STR or DEXmodifier (attackers choice).\n\nUnless specified otherwise, a weapon used to performa weapon option has only the options listed effect anddoesnt deal normal weapon damage. If a weapon optioninstructs a character to make and attack with the weapon,and the character can make multiple attacks with theAttack action, the weapon option replaces only one ofthose attacks.\n\nAt the GMs discretion, some weapon options mightnot work against certain creatures. For example, the tripweapon option might not work against a creature withoutdiscernable legs, such as an ooze, or that is anchored orattached to the ground in some way, such as a tree withanimated limbs.\n\nBASH\n\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can hitthe target in the side of the head or other vital organ,disorienting it fora moment. Make an attack roll with thisweapon. Ona hit, the target is briefly disoriented and hasdisadvantage on its next attack roll.\n\nDISARM\n\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you canchoose to aim a jarring hit at the targets held weapon,knocking it from their grasp. Make an attack roll with thisweapon. Ona hit, the target must succeed ona STRorDEX save (targets choice) or drop its weapon, which landsin an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If no unoccupiedspace is within range, the weapon lands at the targets feet.\n\nlot like a club. At the GMs discretion, a character proficientwith a weapon can use a similar object as if it were thatweapon and add their PB as normal.\n\nIf a character uses a ranged weapon to make a meleeattack or throws a melee weapon that does not have thethrown property, those are considered improvised weapons,and typically deal 1d4 damage of an appropriate damagetype. An improvised thrown weapon typically has range of20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\n#----------#\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

You can use a weapon that has theammunition property to make a ranged attack only if youhave ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each timeyou attack with the weapon, you expend one piece ofammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver,case, or other container is part of the attack (you needa free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the endof an encounter, you can recover half your expendedammunition by taking 1 minute to search the battlefield.\n\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property tomake a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvisedweapon (see Improvised Weapons sidebar). A sling must beloaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\n\nFinesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon,use your choice of your STRor DEX modifier for theattack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifierfor both rolls.\n\nHeavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rollswith heavy weapons. A heavy weapons size and bulk makeit too large for a Small creature to use effectively.\n\nLight. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, makingit ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.\n\nLoading. Because of the time required to load thisweapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from itwhen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it,regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\n\nRange. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attackhas a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrownproperty. The range lists two numbers. The first is theweapons normal range in feet, and the second indicatesthe weapons long range. When attacking a target beyondnormal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. Youcant attack a target beyond the weapons long range.\n\nReach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when youattack with it, as well as when determining your reach foropportunity attacks with it.\n\nThrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you canthrow it to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a meleeweapon, use the same ability modifier for that attack rolland damage roll that you would use for a melee attack withthe weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, use yourSTR, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your STRor your DEX, since the dagger has the finesse property.\n\nTwo-Handed. This weapon requires you to use two handswhen you attack with it.\n\nVersatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands.These weapons have two damage values listed. The higherdamage value is used when you use two hands to make amelee attack.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\n#----------#\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

Most such hirelingshave fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of\n\na craft or art, and a few are experts with specializedadventuring skills.\n\nSome basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table.Other common hirelings include any of the wide varietyof people who inhabit a typical town or city and whom theadventurers pay to perform a specific task. For example,\n\na wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaboratechest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chestspell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge aspecial sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisiteclothing for an upcoming performance for the duke.\n\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerousservices. Mercenary soldiers paid to help take onahobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired toresearch ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurerestablishes a stronghold of some kind, they might hire awhole staff of servants and agents to run the place, froma castellan or steward all the way down to stable cleaners.These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract thatincludes a place to live within the stronghold as part of thecompensation.\n\nSkilled hirelings include anyone employed to performa service that involves a proficiency (including weapon,tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. Thepay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings requiremore pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial workthat requires no particular skill and can include laborers,porters, maids, and similar workers.\n\nMAGIC ITEMS\n\nOf the many rewards available to adventurers, magic itemsare perhaps the most coveted. These powerful objects arecreated using raw magic and are incredibly complicated toproduce. Few beings in the world possess the knowledgeto make magic items, which makes them hard to find andvaluable.\n\nThe GM is the ultimate arbiter of where magic itemsappear, but they are often given as rewards for crawlingthrough deadly dungeons or slaying the creatures thatguard them.\n\nUSING A MAGIC ITEM\n\nUsing a magic items properties might mean wearing\n\nor wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must bedonned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet,gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, andrings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield\n\nstrapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders.Aweapon must be held.\n\nIn most cases, a magic item thats meant to be worncan fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magicgarments are made to be easily adjustable, or theymagically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptionsexist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fitonly creatures of a certain size or shape, the GM can rulethat it doesnt adjust.\n\nWhen a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, it is upto GM discretion as to whether the item functions asintended. A ring placed ona tentacle might work, but aserpentfolk with a tail instead of legs cant wear boots.\n\nMULTIPLE ITEMS OF THE SAME KIND\n\nUse common sense to determine whether more than oneof a given kind of magic item can be worn. A charactercant normally wear more than one pair of footwear, onepair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit\n\nof armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You canmake exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circletunder a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks.\n\nPAIRED ITEMS\n\nItems that come in pairssuch as boots, bracers,gauntlets, and glovesimpart their benefits only if bothitems of the pair are worn. For example, a characterwearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a bootof elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either.\n\nATTUNEMENT\n\nSome magic items require a creature to form a bondwith them before their magical properties can be used.This bond is called attunement, and certain items haveaprerequisite for attunement. If the prerequisite is a class,a creature must be a member of that class to attune to theitem. If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creaturequalifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits orfeatures, not from using a magic item or the like.\n\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requiresattunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits,unless its description states otherwise. For example, amagic shield that requires attunement provides the benefitsof anormal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but noneof its magical properties.\n\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend a shortrest focused on only that item while being in physicalcontact with it. This focus can take the form of weaponpractice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item),or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest isinterrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, atthe end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitiveunderstanding of how to activate any magical properties ofthe item, including any necessary command words.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\n#----------#\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

Each answer should be a complete sentence. Only use information that is in the excerpt this is an EXCERPT from my book.##### EXCERPT:\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time,and a creature can be attuned to no more than a numberof items equal to its proficiency bonus (PB) at any onetime. Any attempt to attune to an additional item fails;the creature must end its attunement to an item first.Additionally, a creature cant attune to more than one copyof an item. For example, a creature cant attune to morethan one ring of protection at a time.\n\nAcreatures attunement to an item ends if the creatureno longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, ifthe item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes tothe item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunementby spending another short rest focused on the item, unlessthe item is cursed.\n\nACTIVATING AN ITEM\n\nActivating some magic items requires a user to dosomething special, such as holding the item and utteringa command word. The description of an item category orindividual item details how an item is activated. Certainitems use the following rules for their activation.\n\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isnt afunction of the Use an Item action.\n\nCOMMAND WORD\n\nAcommand word is a word or phrase that must be\n\nspoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires acommand word cant be activated in an area where sound isprevented, as in the area of the silence spell.\n\nSPELLS\n\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from theitem. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell ring,doesnt expend any of the users spell slots, and requires nocomponents, unless the items description says otherwise.The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration,and the user of the item must concentrate if the spellrequires concentration. Many items, such as potions,bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spells effectswith their usual duration. Certain items make exceptionsto these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or otherparts ofa spell.\n\nA magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you touse your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell fromthe item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, youchoose which one to use with the item. If you dont have aspellcasting ability, your spellcasting ability modifier is +0for the item, and your PB does apply.\n\nCHARGES\n\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended toactivate their properties. The number of charges an item\n\nhas remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it,as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, whenan item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learnshow many charges it regained.\n\nMAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS\n\nThis section lists some magic items found within theknown universe.

Magic is themanipulation of those energies to change reality. Thosewho can harness such energies are called spellcasters.\n\nSpellcasters are categorized into groups based on thesource of their power. Regardless of sources, the laws thatrule these reality-shaping effects, known as spells, are thesame. This section outlines the rules of spellcasting andincludes a selection of commonly seen spells.\n\nWHAT IS A SPELL?\n\nA spell is a manipulation of reality accomplished using\n\na combination of will and energy. Every spell must haveenergy to fuel its effects and a spellcaster capable ofcontrolling the flow of energy. Spells can accomplish anynumber of thingsharm, protection, problem-solvingall guided by a casters imagination.\n\nCreating a new spell is a work of extreme creativity andintense effort, often resulting from a lifetime of study.Because of this, most casters choose their spells fromestablished pools of knowledge.\n\nCIRCLES OF MAGIC\n\nCircles of magic represent primary sources that fuelspellcaster abilities. This section details two circles of magic,arcane and divine, and explains their roles in spellcasting.\n\nARCANE CIRCLE\n\nThe arcane circle draws its power from manipulatingmeasurable forces that govern material reality. Thisincludes forces like heat, space, and gravity. An arcanecaster uses a precise combination of words, gestures, andmaterials to ignite a roaring flame or link two locationshundreds of miles apart.\n\nArcane magic is governed by an extensive set of rulesand calculations, which a caster uses to enact effects. Itcan resemble a science more than mystical workings.Harnessing magic from this circle requires creativity,precision, and a drive for perfection.\n\nThe tools of arcane magic are varied and often highlypersonal to the caster. Common tools include runes,recitations, and hand gestures.\n\nConversion from 5th Edition. When converting fifthedition spells into circles of magic, these qualities indicatethat a spell might be arcane:\n\nâ€¢ The spell detects, suppresses, ends, or otherwise\n\ninteracts with mechanical aspects of spellcasting.\n\nâ€¢ The spell harnesses elemental energy (acid, cold, fire,\n\nlightning, or thunder).\n\nâ€¢ The spell interacts with the five senses, whether to foolthem or to extend their capabilities.\n\nDIVINE CIRCLE\n\nThe divine circle draws its power from the connectivitybetween beings. A divine caster can imbue a dying creaturewith the will to live, channel the wrath of a god into a firestorm, or restore withered crops to a starving community.\n\nDivine magic requires a connection between the casterand at least one other being to function. Harnessing magicfrom this circle requires devotion, awareness of others, andbelief in improving the world for those served.\n\nThe common model for divine magic frames it withinreligious faith, where an individual enacts the will of a god.However, the divine circle is also accessible to a caster whoacts out of devotion to a particular community, an evilpact set forth by a cult, or any similarly compelling source.Wherever need exists, there is the potential for divinemagic.\n\nConversion from 5th Edition. When converting fifthedition spells into circles of magic, these qualities indicatethat a spell might be divine:\n\nâ€¢ The spell specifically interacts with another creatureslife force, whether to heal or harm.\n\nâ€¢ The spell harnesses radiant or necrotic energy.\n\nâ€¢ The spell specifies interaction with a deity or includesthe word faith in the description.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\n#----------#\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

Each answer should be a complete sentence. Only use information that is in the excerpt this is an EXCERPT from my book.##### EXCERPT:\nSPELL RINGS\n\nEvery spell is categorized into a ring, ranked from Ist tooth. Higher rings require more energy to fuel the spell andhave stronger effects.\n\nLike the rings within a tree trunk, rings of magic encircleone another. A novice spellcaster starts at the center of thecircle with access to the Ist ring. As they grow in ability,their powers expand toward the circles edge, giving accessto more rings. The further a ring is from the center, thehigher level a spellcaster must be to use that rings spells.\n\nEach class provides a table of what spellcaster level youmust achieve before you gain access to new spell rings.Typically, a spellcaster must be at least 17th level beforethey can cast spells from the 9th and final ring.\n\nSPELL SLOTS\n\nSpell slots are a measure of the energy a caster has tofuel their spells. Check the progression table for yourspellcasting class to see how many spell slots your characterhas at a given level. As you gain levels, you gain new slots tocast spells from higher rings and more slots for spells fromlower rings.\n\nAcaster who has used all their spell slots is spent,physically and mentally. Theyre out of energy for spells.To replenish spell slots, you must complete a short or longresteach class specifies which type of rest and how manyslots you regain. This rest represents the time needed torecover from the toll spellcasting takes on the body andmind.\n\nSCHOOLS OF MAGIC\n\nPractitioners and sages have attempted to quantify andcategorize the complexities of magic into eight universallyrecognized categories known as spell schools. Theseschools have no inherent influence ona spell, but they helpidentify a spells effect. Specific class features or characterabilities may refer to these schools. The eight schools arebroadly explained in this section.\n\nABJURATION\n\nAbjuration spells use wards, shields, and other means ofdeflection to defend their target. Such spells might looklike creating a force shield to block incoming missiles orimbuing a homestead with a ward to deter unwanted pests.\n\nCONJURATION\n\nConjuration spells restructure space, enabling objects,creatures, and other targets to be transported from place toplace. Such spells might look like causing a lost house keyto appear in your hand or creating a portal that allows forinstantaneous travel to a far-flung realm of existence.\n\nDIVINATION\n\nDivination spells collect information, allowing a user toglean locations, outcomes, or sensory feedback beyond thelimitations of standard perception. Such spells might looklike sensing the location of a hidden entrance or receiving avision of future events.\n\nENCHANTMENTEnchantment spells influence the minds of creatures,allowing a user to manipulate emotions or behavior.\n\nEVOCATION\n\nEvocation spells shape energy, allowing a user to channelhealing, change air into roaring flame, or stir the skies intoa raging storm.\n\nILLUSIONIllusion spells deceive the senses, allowing a user to maskor alter the truth and create objects that seem real.\n\nNECROMANCYNecromancy spells manipulate life, allowing a user to useanothers life force to heal or reanimate the dead.\n\nTRANSMUTATION\n\nTransmutation spells alter the forms of creatures orobjects, allowing a user to turn lead into gold or transforman enemy into a toad.\n\nKNOWN SPELLS\n\nA spellcaster must be extremely familiar with a spell orpossess a magic item imbued with the spell to cast it. Eachspellcasting class solves this familiarity issue differently.\n\nFor example, a wizard catalogs their known spells inaspellbook and adds to it whenever they discover a new spell.Your character class defines how many spells you know andcan potentially learn as you gain more class levels.\n\nPREPARED SPELLS\n\nA prepared spell is ready to cast quickly, in the heat ofbattle, without extensive reading or setup. Due to theintense mental fortitude necessary, the number of spells acaster can prepare at one time is generally limited.\n\nSome spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, mustprepare all their spells ahead of time through study ormeditation. Different spellcasting classes with shorterknown spell lists can automatically prepare all their knownspells.\n\nYour character class defines what you must do to preparespells and how many spells you can have prepared at anygiven level.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\n#----------#\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

A cantrip can be cast without using a spell slotand without being prepared. Repeated practice has fixedthe spell in the casters mind and infused the caster with theenergy needed to produce the effect on demand. A cantripsspell ring is o.\n\nYour class defines whether you can access cantrips, andhow many cantrips you knowat each class level.\n\nRITUALS\n\nRitual spells are uniquely powerful magic that takes 1minute or longer to cast and often requires costly materialcomponents. A caster can only learn ritual spells associatedwith their circle of magic.\n\nRitual spells dont use spell slots. Otherwise, ritual spellsfollow normal spellcasting rules.\n\nYour character class defines whether you can access ritualspells, and how many rituals you know at each class level.\n\nCASTING IN ARMOR\n\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures requiredfor spellcasting, you must be proficient with any armor youare wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distractedand hampered for spellcasting.\n\nCOMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS\n\nThe effects of different spells combine while the durationsof those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell castmultiple times dont combine, however. Instead, the mostpotent effect, such as the highest bonus from multiplecastings, applies while their durations overlap.\n\nFor example, if two wizards cast mage armor on the sametarget, that target gains the spells benefit only once; theydont get multiple AC bonuses.\n\nELEMENTS OF A SPELL\n\nWhen a character casts a spell, the basic rules are the sameregardless of the spell ring or its circle.\n\nEach spell in this chapter includes basic information,including the spells name, ring, circle, school, castingtime, range, required components, and duration. Everyspell also contains a description of its effect.\n\nCASTING TIME\n\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some can beaccomplished in a shorter or longer span.\n\nA spell cast with a bonus action is fast. You must use abonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided youhavent already taken a bonus action this turn. If you useyour bonus action to cast a spell from the Ist ring or higheron your turn, you cant also use your action to cast a spellfrom the Ist ring or higher during the same turn.\n\nREACTION\n\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take\n\na fraction ofa second to bring about and are cast inresponse to specific triggering events. Ifa spell can be castas a reaction, the spell description specifies the triggerrequired.\n\nLONGER CASTING TIMES\n\nCertain spells (particularly rituals) require more time tocast, minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with\n\na casting time longer than a single action or reaction,\n\nyou must spend your action each turn casting, and\n\nyou must maintain concentration while you do so (seeConcentration). If your concentration is broken, the spellfails, but the attempt doesnt use a spell slot. To try castingthe spell again, you must start over.\n\nRANGE\n\nThe target of a spell must be within the spells range. Fora spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. Fora spelllike fireball, the target is a point in space where the ball offire erupts.\n\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells cantarget only a creature (including you) that you touch. Otherspells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spellshavea range of self.\n\nSpells that appear in cones or lines that originate fromyou also have a range of self, indicating that the originpoint must be you (see Area of Effect).\n\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects arent limited by its rangeunless the spells description says otherwise.\n\nAREA OF EFFECT\n\nSpells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area,allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n\nA spells description specifies its area of effect, whichtypically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point oforigin, a location from which the spells energy erupts. Thetules for each shape specify how you position its origin.Usually, the origin is a point in space that you choosewithin the spells range, but some spells originate from acreature or an object.\n\n#####END#####\n\n\n#----------#\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

To block one of these straightlines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\n\nCONE\n\nAcone extends ina direction you choose from its point of\n\norigin. A cones width at a given point along its length is\n\nequal to that points distance from the point of origin.

The cubes size is expressed as thelength of each side.\n\nA cubes point of origin is not included in the cubes areaof effect unless you decide otherwise.\n\nCYLINDERAcylinders point of origin is the center of a circle of aparticular radius, as given in the spell description. Thecircle must either be on the ground or at the height of thespell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straightlines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle,forming the base of the cylinder. The spells effect thenshoots up from the base or down from the top to a distanceequal to the height of the cylinder.\n\nAcylinders point of origin is included in the cylindersarea of effect.\n\nLINEAline extends from its point of origin ina straight path upto its length and covers an area defined by its width.\n\nA lines point of origin is not included in the lines area ofeffect unless you decide otherwise.\n\nSPHEREYou select a spheres point of origin, and the sphere extendsoutward from that point. The spheres size is expressed as aradius in feet that extends from the point.\n\nA spheres point of origin is included in the spheres areaof effect.\n\nCOMPONENTS\n\nA spells components are the physical requirements youmust meet to cast it. Each spells description indicateswhether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M)components. If you cant provide one or more of a spellscomponents, you cant cast the spell.\n\nVERBAL (V)\n\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. Thecombination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance,sets the magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gaggedor in an area of silence, such as one created by the silencespell, cant cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\nSOMATIC (S)\n\nSpellcasting might include a forceful gesticulation oran intricate set of motions. Ifa spell requires a somaticcomponent, the caster must have free use of at least onehand to perform these gestures.\n\nMATERIAL (M)\n\nCasting some spells requires specific objects detailed\n\nin parentheses in the component entry. A character canuse a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found inEquipment) in place of the components specified for aspell. However, ifa cost is indicated for a component, apouch or focus cant substitute for it. The character musthave that specific component to cast the spell.\n\nIfa spell states that a material component is consumed bythe spell, the caster must provide this component for eachcasting of the spell.\n\nA spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spellsmaterial componentsor to hold a spellcasting focusbut it can be the same hand that they use to performsomatic components.\n\nDURATION\n\nA spells duration is the length of time the spell persists.A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, or evenyears. Some spells specify that their effects last until thespells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\nINSTANTANEOUS\n\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals,creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that cantbe dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\nSome spells require concentration to keep the magic active.If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that factappears in its duration entry, and it specifies how long youcan concentrate on it. You can end concentration at anytime (no action required).\n\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesntinterfere with concentration. The following factors canbreak concentration:\n\nâ€¢ Casting another spell that requires concentration.You lose concentration ona spell if you cast anotherspell that requires concentration.

Whenever you take damage while youare concentrating on a spell, you must make a CONsave to maintain your concentration. The DC of thissave equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichevernumber is higher. If you take damage from multiplesources, such as an arrow and a dragons breath, youmake a separate save for each source of damage.\n\nâ€¢ Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentrationona spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.\n\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmentalphenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while youreona storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a CONsave to maintain concentration ona spell.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nEach spell includes a description of its effects, includingkey information about how the spell works.\n\nTARGETS\n\nAtypical spell requires you to pick one or more targets tobe affected by the spells magic. A spell tells you whetherthe spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin foran area of effect (described in the Area of Effect section).\n\nUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature mightnot know it was targeted bya spell at all. An effect likecrackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect,such as an attempt to read a creatures thoughts, typicallygoes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n\nSPELL LISTS\n\nA CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGETTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so itcant be behind total cover.\n\nIf you place an area of effect at a point that you cant seeand an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and thepoint, the point of origin comes into being on the near sideof that obstruction.\n\nTARGETING YOURSELF\n\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can chooseyourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specificallya creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of aspell you cast, you can target yourself.\n\nSPELL SAVES\n\nMany spells specify that a target can make a save to avoidsome or all ofa spells effects. The spell specifies the abilitythe target uses for the save and what happens ona successor failure.\n\nThe DC to resist a spell equals 8 + the casters spellcastingability modifier + the casters PB + any special modifiers.\n\nSPELL ATTACK ROLLS\n\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll todetermine whether the spell effect hits the intended target.Acasters attack bonus with a spell attack equals theirspellcasting ability modifier + their PB.\n\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve rangedattacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a rangedattack roll ifyou are within 5 feet of a hostile creature thatcan see you and that isnt incapacitated.\n\nThis section lists the spells available to casters of the various circles of magic. The list is organized by circle, then by spell ring.Each spell also belongs to a school of magic, which is identified in parentheses after the spells name.\n\nARCANE CIRCLE SPELL LIST\n\nThese spells are available to casterswho draw power from the arcane circle.\n\nCANTRIPS\n\nAcid Splash (Conjuration)Dancing Lights (Evocation)Fire Bolt (Evocation)\n\nGrave Touch (Necromancy)Light (Evocation)\n\nMage Hand (Conjuration)Mending (Transmutation)Message (Transmutation)Minor Illusion (Illusion)\n\nPoison Spray (Conjuration)Prestidigitation (Transmutation)Ray of Frost (Evocation)Shocking Grasp (Evocation)\n\nTrue Strike (Divination)\n\n1ST RING\n\nBurning Hands (Evocation)\n\nCharm Person (Enchantment)\n\nColor Spray (Illusion)\n\nComprehend Languages (Divination)Detect Magic (Divination)\n\nDisguise Self (Illusion)\n\nExpeditious Retreat (Transmutation)\n\nFalse Life (Necromancy)\n\nFeather Fall (Transmutation)\n\nFire under the Tongue (Transmutation)\n\nFloating Disk (Conjuration)\n\nFog Cloud (Conjuration)\n\nGrease (Conjuration)\n\nHideous Laughter (Enchantment)\n\nLongstrider (Transmutation)\n\nMage Armor (Abjuration)\n\nMagic Missile (Evocation)\n\nProtection from Evil and Good(Abjuration)\n\nShield (Abjuration)\n\nSilent image (Illusion)\n\n#####END#####\n\n\n#----------#\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.

If you choose an object, that object must remainin its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet fromwhere you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spellends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successfulINT (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to befound.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell.For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggersinclude touching or standing on the glyph, removinganother object covering the glyph, approaching within acertain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object onwhich the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed withinan object, the most common triggers include opening thatobject, approaching within a certain distance of the object,or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered,this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activatesonly under certain circumstances or according to physicalcharacteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind(for example, the ward could be set to affect Aberrationsor drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions forcreatures that dont trigger the glyph, such as those who sayacertain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes oraspell glyph.\n\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts withmagical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on theglyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature inthe area must make a DEX save. A creature takes 5d8 acid,cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed save(your choice when you create the glyph), or half as muchdamage ona successful one.\n\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd ring orlower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph.The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spellbeing stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If thespell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered theglyph. Ifthe spell affects an area, the area is centered onthat creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures orcreates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close aspossible to the intruder and attack it. Ifthe spell requiresconcentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n\nIDENTIFY\n\nist-Ring Arcane Ritual (Divination)\n\n#####END#####\n\n\n#----------#\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from my book.
