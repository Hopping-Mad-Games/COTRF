        "\n\nCHAPTER 1: CHARACTER CREATION\nThe first step to play is creating your player character (PC)Character creation involves making rules choices that define who your character is and what your character is good at, as well as creative choices about your character’s history and personality.This chapter contains exact steps and options to create your character. If you are creating a character for the first time, it can be helpful to work with your game master (GM) to choose options that make a good play experience.Step-by-Step Character CreationThese are the steps needed to create your character.\n\nSTEP 0. GATHER MATERIALS\nMake sure these basic tools are handy to record your character choices:- pencil\n- blank character sheet\n- scratch paper\n- dice (see About Those Dice in the sidebar)\n\n\nABOUT THOSE DICE\nThe Black Flag Roleplaying system uses polyhedral dice to resolve actions. These dice are abbreviated in game text, so a four-sided die is a d4, a six-sided die is a d6, and so on for d8, d10, d12, and d20Percentile dice rolls (1–100) are rolled with two dice and abbreviated d%\n\nSTEP 1. CREATE A CHARACTER CONCEPT\nIt can help to think about what kind of character you want to play before you start picking from lists. Do you want to cast magic spells? Do you want to be good at swinging a sword? Do you want to play as a human or a member of some more fantastical lineage? Knowing what sounds like fun to you can help guide your decisions.Talk to the other players about your ideas if they’re around. Hearing what other players have in mind can help focus your choices or inspire you to create a concept that works well with other adventurers in your partyFor example, if all the other PCs are rough-and-tumble warriors, you might want to make a cleric so you can patch them up with healing magic!\n\nSTEP 2. CHOOSE A CLASS\nChoosing your character’s class is the most important factor in bringing your concept into the game. Your character’s class is sort of like their job. Each class covers a different set of capabilities and responsibilities.Your character class gives you class features at 1st level as described in each class features table (see Character Classes later in this chapter) and lists other features you gain access to as your character gains adventuring experience and levels up. Your choice of character class also dictates your proficiencies, which is a game term describing what kinds of equipment you are trained to use (like armor, weapons, or tools) and what kinds of challenges you are best at handling (skills and saves).Choosing your character class can also help you make other decisions. For example, each class has a Quick Build section that tells you which ability scores (described in Step 3) work best with your class abilities.See the Class Options at a Glance table later in this chapter for a brief summary and comparison of each class\n\nSTEP 3. DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES\nAt their core, characters are defined by six abilities:- Strength (STR), representing your physical might.\n- Dexterity (DEX), representing your agility and \nreaction time.- Constitution (CON), representing your endurance \nand physical fortitude.- Intelligence (INT), representing your ability to \nacquire and apply knowledge.- Wisdom (WIS), representing your intuition and \nmental fortitude.- Charisma (CHA), representing your self-confidence \nand your ability to influence others.Each ability is assigned a number, called an ability scoreThese scores represent your various physical and mental abilities. Higher numbers in a score mean you character is better with that abilityAs you level up, you can increase these scores, but a PC can never have an ability score higher than 20. An average person has 10 in every ability score, so these numbers emphasize how powerful adventurers are!\n\nTHREE WAYS TO SCORE\nThere are three methods to determine your starting ability scores. No method is “better” than another, but some people like one way more, so we include them to appeal to different kinds of players.\n\nMETHOD ONE: ROLLING\nThis is the classic, providing surprises and maybe a tough choice. It helps make a character you adapt to, instead of you making all the decisions:- Roll four d6s. Find the lowest die and throw it out\nThen add up the remaining three dice to get your totalWrite that number down on scratch paper.- Do this five more times until you have six totals \nbetween 3 and 18.- Assign those six numbers to the ability scores however \nyou like.- Finally, add 2 to one score of your choice that is 16 or \nbelow and add 1 to one score of your choice that is 17 or below\n\nMETHOD TWO: POINT-BUY\nIf you don’t want to leave it up to chance, you can assign ability scores with the point-buy method:- Start with 32 points to spend on your ability scores\n- Each score costs a certain number of points. Find the \ncost of each potential score on the Point-Buy Cost table. (As an example, a score of 12 costs 4 points.)- 18 is the highest ability score you can start with, and you \ncan’t have a score lower than 8- Buy one score for each of the six abilities.\n- Don’t add anything extra when you’re done here. These \nnumbers are already balanced without adding more.\n\nPOINT-BUY COST\n\n\nSCORE COST SCORE COST SCORE COST\n\n\n8 0 12 4 16 11\n\n\n9 1 13 5 17 13\n\n\n10 2 14 7 18 16\n\n\n11 3 15 9\n\n\nMETHOD THREE: STANDARD ARRAY\nTo get started faster, use the standard array. Start with six numbers: 16, 14, 14, 13, 10, and 8. Assign them as ability scores however you want. Again, don’t modify them any further. That’s it!\n\nFIND ABILITY MODIFIERS\nOnce you assign scores, use the following charts to figure out your ability modifiers. Your ability modifiers are the most important part of your ability scores. You use your modifiers much more than your score to calculate success or failure in the game.\n\nABILITY MODIFIERS\n\n\nABILITY \n\n\nSCORE MODIFIER\n\n\nABILITY \n\n\nSCORE MODIFIER\n\n\n1 −5 12–13 +1\n\n\n2–3 −4 14–15 +2\n\n\n4–5 −3 16–17 +3\n\n\n6–7 −2 18–19 +4\n\n\n8–9 −1 20 +5\n\n\n10–11 +0\nPC Wisdom: When you see an ability referenced in the rules, assume it means the ability score modifier (−1, 0, +1, +2, etc.) rather than the ability score itself (8, 10, 12, 14, etc.). For example, if a feature reads “. . . roll and add your STR,” that means add your Strength ability modifier, not your full Strength ability score\n\nSTEP 4. CHOOSE A LINEAGE\nChoose your character’s lineage from the options in the Lineage section later in this chapter. Lineage tells you about certain hereditary traits such as average lifespan, size, speed, and any special adaptations like the ability to see in the dark.Lineage represents the blood ties and hereditary traits of a creature. Adventurers can be humans or a common fantasy lineage, like dwarf or elf\n\nSTEP 5. CHOOSE A HERITAGE\nChoose your character’s heritage from the options in the Heritage section later in this chapter. Heritage tells you about traits your character has because of their connection to a particular group or society.Heritage represents the upbringing and culture of a character. Adventurers can come from nearly any kind of fantasy society, such as a big city, a forest enclave, or an underground citadel\n\nSTEP 6. CHOOSE A BACKGROUND\nChoose your character’s background from the options in the Backgrounds section later in this chapter. Backgrounds give you skill proficiencies, talents, and languages learned.Backgrounds represent what your character did as an individual before they took up the adventuring lifeAdventurers are often a motley group and come from a wide variety of backgrounds. Backgrounds include options like adherent or scholar.\n\nSTEP 7. FILL IN THE BLANKS\nAt this point, your big decisions are locked in. You still need to equip your character (see Chapter 3) and pick spells if they’re a spellcaster (see Chapter 4). But you’ve got the basics squared away.Take some time to look things over and fill in any blank sections on your character sheet (see Final Checklist below).Make sure to give your character a name and decide what they look like. It’s also a good idea to think about your character’s history and personality—but it’s perfectly fine to decide these details later. You might discover more about who you want your character to be after playing for a couple of game sessions"

        "Sure! Here are the steps to create a new character:\n\n1. Choose a race: The race you choose will determine your character's abilities and traits. Some races, like elves, are known for their dexterity and longevity. Others, like dwarves, are hardy and durable. Let me know which race you'd like to be.\n\n2. Choose a class: The class you choose will determine your character's abilities and skills. Since you mentioned wanting to be a cleric, that will be your class. Clerics are divine spellcasters who have access to healing and support spells. They can also wield weapons and wear armor. \n\n3. Determine ability scores: Ability scores represent your character's natural talents and strengths. The main ability scores for a cleric are Wisdom and Constitution. Since you mentioned wanting a dexterous and hearty character, you may want to prioritize Dexterity for improved archery skills and Constitution for increased durability. \n\n4. Select skills and proficiencies: As a cleric, you will have proficiency in certain skills, such as Medicine and Religion. You may also have proficiency with certain weapons, armor, and tools. Let me know which skills and proficiencies you'd like your character to have.\n\n5. Choose a background: Your character's background provides additional skills, tools, and role-playing hooks. It can also influence your character's personality and backstory. Let me know if you have any preferences for your character's background.\n\n6. Determine equipment: As a cleric, you will start with certain equipment, such as a holy symbol, a set of priest's vestments, and a simple weapon. Since you mentioned wanting to use a longbow, we can make sure your character has one as well.\n\nLet's start with step 1. Which race would you like your character to be?"

Now, let's move on to the next step: determining your ability scores.\n\nFor your character, you mentioned wanting high Dexterity and Constitution. These scores will affect your character's archery skills, physical endurance, and overall survivability. \n\nWe can use the \"Rolling\" method to determine your ability scores. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Roll four six-sided dice (d6) and record the total of the highest three rolls. Repeat this process five more times to get a total of six scores.\n\n2. Assign these scores to your ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) as you see fit.\n\n3. Additionally, add 2 to one score of your choice that is 16 or below, and add 1 to one score of your choice that is 17 or below.\n\nIf you're ready, let's start rolling!"

        "To create your character, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Create a Character Concept\nThink about the kind of character you want to play. In your case, you want a super dexterous and hearty cleric who uses a long bow.\n\nStep 2: Choose a Class\nSince you want to play a cleric, choose the cleric class. Clerics are divine spellcasters who are skilled in healing magic and have a wide range of support abilities.\n\nStep 3: Determine Ability Scores\nYour character's ability scores represent their physical and mental abilities. As a cleric, you'll want high Dexterity for your archery skills and high Constitution for your endurance. You can use one of the three methods described in the sidebar to determine your ability scores: Rolling, Point-Buy, or Standard Array.\n\nStep 4: Choose a Lineage\nLineage represents your character's hereditary traits. Choose a lineage that complements your concept of a dexterous and hearty cleric. Some lineages may provide bonuses to Dexterity or Constitution.\n\nStep 5: Choose a Heritage\nHeritage represents your character's upbringing and cultural background. Choose a heritage that fits your character concept and provides any additional bonuses or abilities.\n\nStep 6: Choose a Background\nBackgrounds represent what your character did before becoming an adventurer. Choose a background that aligns with your character's personality and provides skill proficiencies and other benefits.\n\nStep 7: Fill in the Blanks\nAt this point, most of your major decisions are made. Fill in the remaining details on your character sheet, such as name, appearance, and personality. You can also think about your character's history, but it's okay to develop those details as you play.\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, you'll have your character ready to embark on adventures as a dexterous and hearty cleric with a long bow!"

Are there any other skills or proficiencies you'd like your character to have?\n\n3. Choose a background: Your character's background provides additional skills, tools, and role-playing hooks.

Each class covers a different set of capabilities and responsibilities.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Your character class gives you class features at 1st level as described in each class features table (see Character Classes later in this chapter) and lists other features you gain access to as your character gains adventuring experience and levels up. Your choice of character class also dictates your proficiencies, which is a game term describing what kinds of equipment you are trained to use (like armor, weapons, or tools) and what kinds of challenges you are best at handling (skills and saves).\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Choosing your character class can also help you make other decisions.

An average person has 10 in every ability score, so these numbers emphasize how powerful adventurers are!\n            </paragraph>\n            <sidebar>\n                <title>THREE WAYS TO SCORE</title>\n                <paragraph>\n                    There are three methods to determine your starting ability scores.

        "Talents represent the specific ways an adventurer has improved over the course of their adventures. Talents are divided into three categories: magic talents, martial talents, and technical talents. Your class typically determines which talent lists you have access to. Talents are gained in two main ways:\n\n1. When a character chooses their background during character creation, they select one talent from a list of options provided in the background.\n\n2. When a character class grants an Improvement, they choose a talent from the list specified by their class features, assuming the character meets any necessary prerequisites.\n\nMAGIC TALENTS:\n\nMost magic talents affect a character's spellcasting abilities, but they also include features that strengthen the mind and defend against harmful magic effects.\n\n1. COMBAT CASTING:\n   - Prerequisite: Ability to Cast Spells\n   - Benefits:\n     - Automatically succeed on concentration saves for spells with a DC equal to or lower than 8 + your PB.\n     - Use your reaction to cast a cantrip instead of making a melee attack when a hostile creature provokes an opportunity attack from you.\n     - Use a shield or weapon as a spellcasting focus and perform somatic spell components with the same hand or hands holding the focus.\n\n2. ELEMENTAL SAVANT:\n   - Prerequisite: Ability to Cast at Least One Spell that Deals Damage\n   - Benefits:\n     - Choose one elemental damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Convert the damage type of a spell to your chosen element.\n     - Reroll any damage dice results of 1 for a spell that naturally uses your chosen elemental damage type.\n     - Can be selected multiple times to choose different damage types.\n\n3. MENTAL FORTITUDE:\n   - Benefits:\n     - Once per long rest, when you fail an INT, WIS, or CHA save, you can reroll the save.\n     - Repeat the save at the end of each turn to end charmed, frightened, or stunned conditions caused by a failed save.\n\n4. MENTAL PROWESS:\n   - Benefits:\n     - Increase CHA, INT, or WIS ability score by 1 (up to a maximum of 20).\n     - Can be selected multiple times.\n\n5. RITUALIST:\n   - Prerequisite: Ability to Cast Spells\n   - Benefits:\n     - Gain a ritual book and cast ritual spells from it.\n     - Choose a circle of magic: arcane or divine, and select rituals from that circle's list.\n     - Add one ritual spell of each spell ring you have unlocked to your ritual book.\n     - Add one new ritual spell of a ring you gain access to with each new level.\n     - Must be from the same circle of magic and a ring you have spell slots for.\n     - Can be selected multiple times.\n\n6. SCHOOL SPECIALIZATION:\n   - Prerequisite: Ability to Cast Spells\n   - Benefits:\n     - Choose one of the eight schools of magic.\n     - +1 to attack rolls and increased DC for spells from the chosen school.\n     - Halved gold and time to copy spells of that school into a spellbook.\n     - Can be selected multiple times.\n\nMARTIAL TALENTS:\n\nMartial talents affect a character's combat abilities, including enhancements to overall fitness and the ability to wield weaponry.\n\n1. ARMORED COMBATANT:\n   - Benefits:\n     - +1 AC while wearing medium or heavy armor.\n     - Reduce bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage taken by an amount equal to your PB.\n\n2. ARTILLERIST:\n   - Prerequisite: STR Score of 13 or Higher\n   - Benefits:\n     - Ignore loading property of simple and martial weapons.\n     - Advantage on attack rolls with siege weapons or large projectile-launching objects.\n\n3. COMBAT CONDITIONING:\n   - Benefits:\n     - Increase hit point maximum based on previous levels and each new level.\n     - Ignore hit dice rolls lower than your PB when recovering hit points.\n\n4. HAND TO HAND:\n   - Benefits:\n     - Unarmed strikes deal 1d4 + STR bludgeoning damage.\n     - Advantage on ability checks to initiate or escape a grapple.\n\n5. PHYSICAL FORTITUDE:\n   - Benefits:\n     - Once per long rest, reroll a failed STR or CON save.\n     - Repeat saves at the end of each turn to end blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned conditions caused by a failed save.\n\n6. PHYSICAL PROWESS:\n   - Benefits:\n     - Increase STR, DEX, or CON ability score by 1 (up to a maximum of 20).\n     - Can be selected multiple times.\n\n7.

        "CHAPTER 2: PLAYING THE GAME\n\n29 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n is chapter details how the game works, breaking down the mechanical rules and elements necessary for play.\nRolling the Dice\nMost of what happens during Black Flag  game play can \nbe handled through conversations between the player characters (PCs) and the Game Master (GM). But whenever a PC a empts something remarkable, where there is the potential to fail, it s time to roll the dice. Your character s ability modifiers and proficiencies can increase your chances of success, along with other factors covered here.\n is section describes how dice rolls are used to \ndetermine success or failure. It outlines the stages of making a roll and how a roll may be affected by character capabilities or external circumstances.\nMAKING CHECKS\nMost dice rolls in the Black Flag Roleplaying game are checks. All checks involve rolling a 20-sided die called a d20. \nTo make a check, roll a d20 to determine your starting number.  en add one of the ability modifiers on your character sheet. Finally, if you are proficient in something relevant to the roll, add your proficiency bonus (PB).  e total of those numbers is your check result.\nCheck Formula\nCheck Result = d20 + Ability Modifier + PB (If you have a relevant proficiency) \nSTAGES OF A CHECK\n   Player describes the task they want to accomplish.\n   GM decides if a check is needed. If not, play continues. \nIf a check is needed, proceed to next step.\n   GM declares what kind of check is needed, including \nwhich ability modifier it uses and what proficiencies  are relevant.\n\u000e   GM determines if the check is being made with \nadvantage or disadvantage.\n   Player rolls a d20 (or two d20s if they have advantage or \ndisadvantage).\n   Player adds their ability modifier and PB (if they have a \nrelevant proficiency) to the number rolled to determine their check result.\n   If desired, a PC spends Luck points to increase the \ncheck result.\n   GM compares the check result to the check DC and \ndeclares whether the check succeeds or fails.\nABILITY MODIFIERS\nAll checks in the game are tied to one of the six ability modifiers Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Wisdom (WIS), Intelligence (INT), or Charisma (CHA). You add one of these six ability modifiers to every check.  e rules typically dictate which modifier you must use for a particular check, but in cases where no ability is listed, the GM decides which one is relevant. \nFor more information about applying ability modifiers to checks, see the  ich Ability Modifier? sidebar.\nPROFICIENCY BONUS\nAll PCs have a proficiency bonus determined by their level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. \nOnly add your PB to a die roll or DC once. For example, if two different rules allow you to add your PB to a WIS save, you may add it only once.\nOccasionally, you might double or halve your PB before you add it. If some circumstance suggests that your PB applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and double or halve it only once.\nIf your PB doesn t apply to a roll, doubling doesn t change that. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your PB when you make INT (History) checks.\n\n29 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nIn general, don t double your PB for a ack rolls or saves.  en you have advantage or disadvantage and a rule lets \nIf some feature or effect allows you to do so, the above rules  you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You still apply. choose which one. For example, if you have advantage or \ndisadvantage on an ability check and roll a 1 and a 13, you DETERMINING SUCCESS OR FAILUREcould reroll the 1 or the 13, but not both.\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the In most cases, you measure your check result against a  use of special abilities, actions, or spells. You can also use \ntarget number the GM sets for you, called a difficulty class  Luck points to grant advantage. Finally, the GM can decide (DC). If your check result is equal to or higher than the  that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the DC, your roll succeeds! If it s less than the DC, you fail.\nother and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a DETERMINING DC situational call.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying30\nMost of the time, the rules tell the GM what a DC should be. For example, a PC must get a check result of 19 or higher to successfully a ack a creature with an AC 19 (AC is one example of a pre-determined DC).\n en the rules don t provide a DC, the GM gets to set an appropriate number. If you re the GM and you aren t sure, think about how hard you want a task to be.  en consult the Typical Difficulty Class table to assign a number. You can always set it at a number that isn t divisible by 5.\nTYPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASS\nDIFFICULTY DC\nHigh Chance of Success 10 or less\n Moderate Chance of Success                          15\nLow Chance of Success 20\n Almost No Chance of Success                         25 or higher\n\u000eLUCK\nEvery PC has a special resource called Luck. Use Luck to influence the result of any ability check, a ack roll, or save you make.\nSPENDING LUCK POINTS\nSpend Luck points on a 1-for-1 bonus to add to any d20 roll you make. For example, if you have 4 Luck points, and roll a 13 on the die, you could spend 2 Luck points and make your result a 15. You then have 2 Luck points to use later. You can t use Luck points to offset the effects of rolling a natural 1 or create the effects of a natural 20. No one is that lucky.\nAlternatively, immediately a er you make an ability check, a ack roll, or save, you can spend 3 Luck points to reroll a single d20 used for that roll.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying30\nADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGEGAINING LUCK POINTS\nSometimes special circumstances allow you to roll a  en you create your character, you start with 0 Luck \ncheck with advantage or force you to roll a check with  points. You gain Luck points in the following ways: disadvantage.    Once per turn, when you fail an a ack roll or save, gain \nRolling with advantage means you roll two d20s, then  1 Luck point. \nuse the higher of the two numbers to calculate your check    e GM can award 1 Luck point to a character as a \nresult.  reward for coming up with a clever idea, excellent Rolling with disadvantage means you roll two d20s,   roleplaying, or trying something interesting but not \nthen use the lower of the two numbers to calculate your  optimal.\ncheck result.    e GM can award Luck points to a party for surviving \nFor example, if you have advantage and roll a 17 and a 5,  difficult encounters or achieving story goals (in \nyou use the 17.

If they conflict at \nall, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying30\nTHE THREE TYPES OF CHECKS\nBlack Flag  rules have three types of checks. All use the same core mechanics described in the Making Checks section, but each is used in different circumstances and has different rules around whether you add your PB to \nthe check result. Each type of check is described in greater detail here.\nATTACK ROLLS\nA ack rolls are checks used almost exclusively during combat for a acking. For a full rundown on a ack rolls, refer to the Combat section later in this chapter.\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\nIf you have proficiency with the weapon you re using (simple or martial), add your PB to the a ack roll.\nSAVES\nSaves are checks made to resist or avoid threats from spells, traps, poisons, diseases, or similar hazards. You don t normally decide to make a save; the GM asks you to make one because your character is at risk of harm.\nTo make a save, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For instance, use your DEX modifier for a DEX save.\n e DC for a save is determined by the effect that calls for it. As an example, when you make a save against a spell, the DC is determined by the caster s spellcasting ability and PB.\n e result of a successful or failed save is described in the effect a er its DC.\nA successful save usually means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\nYour character class gives you proficiency in at least two saves based on which ability modifiers are useful for the class.  e wizard, for example, is proficient in INT and WIS saves. Add your PB to saves according to your class.\nABILITY CHECKS\n en you want to do something that isn t covered by an \na ack roll or save, make an ability check. Since ability checks cover a wide range of tasks, they are slightly more complex than the other two types of checks.\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. \nIf the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is \na success. You overcome the challenge. Otherwise, it s \na failure. You make no progress toward the objective, \nor you make some progress but also suffer a setback, as determined by the GM.\n\u000eCONTESTS\nSometimes your efforts are directly opposed by someone else.  is can occur when multiple creatures try to do the same thing but only one can succeed, such as snatching a magic ring falling to the floor. It can also occur when one creature tries to prevent another one from accomplishing a goal for example, a monster might try to force open \na door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\nEvery participant in a contest makes an ability check. Apply appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, compare the check results. \n e participant with the highest check result wins the contest and either succeeds at the action or prevents other participants from succeeding.\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same.  us, one participant might win by default. If two creatures tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep it closed, a tie means that the door stays shut.\nPASSIVE CHECKS\nA passive check doesn t involve any die rolls.  is kind of ability check can represent an average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again. Or a GM can use it to secretly determine whether a PC succeeds at something the player doesn t know to try to do, such as noticing a hidden monster.\nA passive check total is called a score. Here s how to determine a character s passive score:\n   10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check.\n   If the character has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, \nsubtract 5. \nSo, for example, if a 1st-level character has a WIS +2 ability modifier and is proficient in the Perception skill, \nthey have a passive Perception score of 14 (10 + 2 for WIS + 2 for PB).\nWORKING TOGETHER\nSometimes two or more creatures team up on a job.  e creature with the highest ability modifier is designated the lead for the effort.  at creature can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help given by the others. In combat, this requires the Help action.\nA creature can only provide help if they have capacity to do the task. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves  tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can t work together on a lock-picking job. Moreover, a character can help only when their assistance would be productive.  reading a needle doesn t get any easier with another pair of hands.\n\n31 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nGROUP CHECKS\n en a number of individuals try to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group check. In this case, characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren t.\nTo make a group check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the members succeed (round up), the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.\nGroup checks don t come up o en, and they re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers navigate a swamp, the GM might call for a WIS (Survival) group check to see \nif the whole party can avoid quicksand, sinkholes, and other hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters can guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles \ninto a hazard.\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\nTwo main types of proficiencies can modify an ability check.\nTool Proficiencies\nA tool helps you do something you couldn t otherwise do, such as repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents can give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your PB to any ability check you make using that tool.\nTool use is not tied to a single ability modifier.  e \ncheck depends on what you re trying to do, at the GM s discretion. For example, when using woodcarver s tools, the GM might ask you to make a DEX check to carve \nout fine detail or a STR check to make something out of particularly hard wood.\nSkill Proficiencies\nEvery PC starts the game with skill proficiencies granted by their background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents. Proficiency in a skill means you can add your PB to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, you don t add your PB to ability checks.\nFor example, if a character a empts to climb a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a STR (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the player rolls a d20, adds their character s STR modifier and then adds PB. If the character lacks that proficiency, the player rolls a d20 and adds only their character s STR modifier.\n e rules in a scenario usually prompt a GM to ask for an ability check using a specific skill for example,  Make a WIS (Perception) check.  Sometimes though, more than one skill might reasonably apply to a situation. A player can ask the GM if a different skill is relevant to the check. If the GM agrees, the PC can try a skill they re more proficient in!\n\u000eSKILL DESCRIPTIONS\n e skill descriptions here explain the different ways you can use the skill.\nACROBATICS\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX)\nYour DEX (Acrobatics) check covers your a empt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as running across a sheet of ice, balancing on a tightrope, or staying upright on a rocking ship s deck.  e GM might also call for a DEX (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nANIMAL HANDLING\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)\n en you want to calm a domesticated animal, keep \na mount from ge ing spooked, or intuit an animal s intentions, the GM might call for a WIS (Animal Handling) check. You also make a WIS (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you try something risky.\nARCANA\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)\nYour INT (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and inhabitants of those planes.\nATHLETICS\nAssociated Ability: Strength (STR)\nYour STR (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include:\nClimbing a sheer or slippery cliff, avoiding hazards while scaling a wall, or clinging to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.\nJumping an unusually long distance or pulling off a stunt midjump.\nSwimming or staying afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or a creature tries to pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\nDECEPTION\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA)\nYour CHA (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, verbally or through your actions.  is deception ranges from misleading through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, cheat at gambling, wear a convincing disguise, dull suspicions with false assurances, or smile genuinely while telling a complete whopper.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying32\nHISTORY\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)\nYour INT (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\nINSIGHT\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)\nYour WIS (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone s next move.  is involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nINTIMIDATION\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA)\n en you a empt to influence someone through threats, hostility, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a CHA (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down, or using a broken bo le to suggest that a sneering vizier reconsider.\nINVESTIGATION\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)\n en you look around for clues and make deductions \nbased on those clues, you make an INT (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an INT (Investigation) check.\nMEDICINE\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)\nA WIS (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\nNATURE\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)\nYour INT (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nPERCEPTION\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)\nYour WIS (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to overhear \na conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under \nan open window, or catch the scent of monsters moving stealthily through the forest. You might also try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, such as orcs lying \n\u000ein ambush, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\nPERFORMANCE\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA)\nYour CHA (Performance) check determines how well you delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or other forms of entertainment.\nPERSUASION\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA)\n en you a empt to influence someone or a group of \npeople with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask for a CHA (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use Persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etique e. \nExamples include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\nRELIGION\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)\nYour INT (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\nSLEIGHT OF HAND\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX)\n enever you a empt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting an item on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check.  e GM might also call for a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you li  a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another \nperson s pocket.\nSTEALTH\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX)\nMake a DEX (Stealth) check when you a empt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\nSURVIVAL\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)\n e GM might ask you to make a WIS (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\n\n33 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nHIDING\nThe GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you attempt to hide, make a DEX (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or stop hiding, that check result is contested by the Perception score of a creature who might discover you.\nYou can’t attempt to hide from a creature that can sense you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\nA creature with the invisible condition (see Appendix) can always attempt to hide and has advantage on DEX (Stealth) checks to do so. \nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of \ndanger, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it typically senses you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden \nas you approach a distracted creature, granting you advantage on an attack roll (see Unseen Attackers and Targets in the Combat section of this chapter).\nPerception Score. In a monster or NPC stat block, each creature has a Perception score. Whether a monster \nis actively searching for you or just going about their business, the GM compares your DEX (Stealth) check result to the creature’s Perception score to see whether they notice you.\nWhat Can You See? A big factor in determining whether you can find something is how well you can see. Visibility in an area could be lightly or heavily obscured (see Vision and Light in the Adventuring section of this chapter).\n\u000eAdventuring\n is section covers the various rules that come with exploring the world and some important ways PCs interact with the environment.\nTIME\n en the passage of time ma ers, the GM determines \nhow long a task takes. Talking about the passage of time depends on what characters are trying to do and where they re trying to do it.\nIn combat and other fast-paced situations, the game \nrelies on rounds, a 6-second span of time in which every particpant gets a turn.\nIn a dungeon environment, outside of combat, movement more o en happens on a scale of minutes. It might take \na minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute \nto check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and \na good 10 minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.\nIn a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is o en more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower \nat the heart of the forest hurry across those fi een miles in just under four hours  time.\nFor long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road between cities, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.\nA GM should always feel free to shi  between these scales to match what s happening in the game and to keep things moving at the table.\nMOVEMENT AND TRAVEL\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.\n e GM can summarize movement without calculating exact distances or travel times:  You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening \nof the third day.  Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters:  A er killing the guardian \nat the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch. \nSometimes though, it s important to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer \nis in days, hours, or minutes. Rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they re moving over.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying34\nSPEED\nEvery creature has a speed, the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round.  is number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in a life- threatening situation.\n en the situation is less dire, the following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nTRAVEL PACE\n ile traveling, a party can move at a fast, normal, or \nslow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table.  e table \nstates how far they can move in a period of time for their pace, and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace \nmakes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes \nit possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March.  e Travel Pace table assumes that \ncharacters travel for 8 hours in a day.  ey can push beyond that limit at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column \nfor their pace, and each character must make a CON save at the end of the hour.\n e DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed \nsave, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see Appendix).\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. \nA mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is rare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swi ly.\nTRAVEL PACE\n                DISTANCE TRAVELED PER . . . \n                PACE MINUTE HOUR DAY                                         EFFECT\n−5 penalty to Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles Perception score\n Normal        300 feet        3 miles     24 miles        —\nSlow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles Able to use \nStealth\n\u000eDIFFICULT TERRAIN\n e travel speeds given on the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. However, adventurers o en face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground all considered difficult terrain.\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain  moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nSPECIAL TYPES OF MOVEMENT\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas o en involves more than walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\nCLIMBING, SWIMMING, AND CRAWLING\n ile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement \ncosts 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful STR (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful STR (Athletics) check.\nJUMPING\nYour STR determines how far you can jump.\nLong Jump.  en you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to half your walking speed if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  en you make a standing long jump, you can leap only a quarter of your walking speed. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.\n is rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn t \nma er, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At the \nGM s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 STR (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\n en you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on \na DC 10 DEX (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\nHigh Jump.  en you make a high jump, you leap into \nthe air a number of feet equal to 3 + your STR modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.  en you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a STR (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump.  us, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1‰ times your height.\n\n35 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nFALLING\nA fall from a great height is a common hazard for an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature lands prone and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell to a maximum of 20d6 unless it has a feature or ability that allows it to avoid taking damage from the fall.\nSUFFOCATING\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its CON modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\n en a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its CON modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\nFor example, a creature with a CON modifier of +2 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\nVISION AND LIGHT\n e fundamental tasks of adventuring noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hi ing an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few rely heavily on a character s ability to see.\nDarkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on WIS (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\nA heavily obscured area such as darkness, opaque \nfog, or dense foliage blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see Appendix) when trying to see something in that area.\n e presence or absence of light in an environment \ncreates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\nBright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days can provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a \nspecific radius.\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between \na source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness.  e so  light of twilight and dawn also counts \nas dim light. A brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical darkness.\n\u000eDARKVISION\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision.\nWithin a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nKEENSENSE\nA creature with keensense can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as Oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\nTRUESIGHT\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saves against them, and perceive the true form of a creature with the shapechanger tag or a creature that is transformed by magic.\nFurthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\nFOOD AND WATER\nCharacters who don t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see Appendix). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\nFOOD\nA character needs one pound of food per day. You can make food last longer by eating half rations. Eating half rations \nin a day counts as half a day without food.\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + CON modifier (minimum 1). Beyond that, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of each day.\nOne normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\nWATER\nA character needs one gallon of water per day or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.\nIf the character already has at least one level of exhaustion, the character suffers two levels each day with \nli le or no water.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying36\nINTERACTING WITH OBJECTS\nA character s interaction with objects in an environment is \no en simple to resolve in the game.  e player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what if anything happens.\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. \nIf the lever is rusted in position though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a STR check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place.  e GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task (see Determining DC earlier in this chapter).\nCharacters can also damage objects with weapons \nand spells. Objects are immune to poison damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical \na acks much like creatures can.  e GM determines an object s AC and HP and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of a acks \nit s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example. Objects always fail STR and DEX saves, and they are immune to effects that require other saves.  en an object drops to 0 \nhit points, it breaks.\nA character can also a empt a STR check to break an object.  e GM sets the DC for any such check.\nSTATISTICS FOR OBJECTS\nGiven enough time, it s safe to assume that a PC can (and will) destroy most breakable objects. In these cases, the GM decides what a PC can reasonably accomplish. For example, it is reasonable to say a fighter can never cut through a stone wall with a sword but can chop a candle in half in the time it takes to talk about it.\nHowever, when time is a factor like cu ing through the ropes of a bridge before a horde of angry goblins charges across giving objects some statistics helps everyone understand what s achievable. In these situations, use the following rules to determine an object s armor class and hit points.\nArmor Class. An object s AC is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object by striking it.  e object \ncan t dodge, but its AC represents its material resilience. \n e Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC \nvalues for various substances.\nOBJECT ARMOR CLASS\n SUBSTANCE                     AC                      SUBSTANCE               AC\nCloth, paper, rope 11 Iron, steel 19\n Crystal, glass, ice         13                    Mithral               21\nWood, bone 15 Adamantine 23\n Stone                       17\n\u000eINTERACTING WITH OBJECTS AROUND YOU\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of things you can do during your move or your action:\n• Draw or sheathe a sword\n• Open or close a door\n• Get a potion from your backpack\n• Pick up a dropped weapon\n• Take a bauble from a table\n• Remove a ring from your finger\n• Stuff some food into your mouth\n• Plant a banner in the ground\n• Fish a few coins from your belt pouch\n• Drink all the ale in a flagon\n• Throw a lever or a switch\n• Pull a torch from a sconce\n• Extinguish a small flame\n• Don a mask\n• Pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head\n• Put your ear to a door\n• Kick a small stone\n• Turn a key in a lock\n• Tap the floor with a 10-foot pole\n• Hand an item to another character\nHit Points. An object s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. \n ether an object is fragile or resilient is up to the GM. Large objects tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking any small part of it breaks the whole thing.  e Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit point amounts for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\nOBJECT HIT POINTS\n SIZE                                                 FRAGILE         RESILIENT\nTiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4)\n Small (chest, lute)                               3 (1d6)        10 (3d6)\nMedium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8)\n Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window)             5 (1d10)       27 (5d10)\nHuge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are of \nli le use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder.  at said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and \nan earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object s hit points if you like, though it might be simpler to decide how long the object can withstand whatever force is acting against it and track \n\n37 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nthat. If you do track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section separately. Destroying a smaller section could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 HP.\nObjects and Damage Types. Objects are immune to poison damage. You might decide some damage types are more or less effective against a particular object or substance. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cu ing through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire. As always, use good judgment and let the GM make the call.\nDamage  reshold. Big objects such as castle walls o en \nhave extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold ignores any single a ack that deals damage less than its damage threshold. For example, if a wall has a damage threshold of 10, a acks that deal 9 or less damage to it deal no damage at all.\nRESTING\nHeroic though they might be, adventurers need rest time \nto sleep, eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.\nAdventurers can take short rests during an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.\nSHORT REST\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\nYou can spend one or more hit dice at the end of a short rest, up to your maximum number of hit dice (which is equal to your character s level). For each hit die spent in this way, roll the die and add your character s CON modifier to it.  e character regains hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional hit die a er each roll. You regain some spent hit dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.\nLONG REST\nA long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than \n2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity the character must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.\nAt the end of a long rest, you regain all lost hit points. \nYou also regain spent hit dice, up to half of your maximum (minimum of 1). For example, if your character has 8 hit dice, you regain 4 of them upon finishing a long rest.\nA character can t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\n\u000eCombat\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting.  e game organizes the chaos of combat \ninto a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a ba le takes a turn.  e order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when all participants PCs and monsters alike roll initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\nSURPRISE\nA band of adventurers quietly sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to a ack them. A gelatinous \ncube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until it engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the ba le gains surprise over the other.\n e GM determines who might be surprised. If neither \nside tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the DEX (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the Perception score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn t notice a threat has the surprised condition at the start of the encounter.\nIf you re surprised, you can t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren t.\nINITIATIVE\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. \n en combat starts, every participant makes a DEX check \nto determine their place in the initiative order.  e GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\n e GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest DEX check result to the one with the lowest. \n is is called initiative order, and the GM follows it to determine when each participant acts during each round. Initiative order remains the same from round to round.\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.  e GM can decide the order \nif the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest \nroll going first.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying38\nYOUR TURN\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed  sometimes called your walking speed is noted on your character sheet.\n e most common actions you can take are described in the Actions in Combat section in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.\n e Movement and Position section in this chapter gives more detailed rules for your move.\nYou don t have to move, take an action, or do anything at all on your turn. If you can t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in Actions in Combat.\nBONUS ACTIONS\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. \n e Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a class feature, spell, or other special ability states that you can do something as a bonus action. Otherwise, you don t have a bonus action to take.\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action s timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to take an action also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\nREACTIONS\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to \na trigger, which can occur on your turn or on someone else s.  e opportunity a ack is the most common type of reaction.\n en you take a reaction, you can t take another one \nuntil the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature s turn, that creature can continue its turn right a er the reaction.\n\u000eOTHER ACTIVITY ON YOUR TURN\nYour turn can include a variety of minor flourishes that don t require your action or your move. Some pointers:\n   You can communicate at any time through brief talking \nand gestures.\n   You can interact with one object or feature of the \nenvironment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move, or you could draw your weapon as part of your A ack action.\n   If you want to interact with a second object, you need to \ncommit your action to it.\n   Some magic items and other special objects always \nrequire an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\n e GM might require you to use an action for any \nof these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\nMOVEMENT AND POSITION\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant \nmotion, o en using movement and position to gain the upper hand.\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as li le of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming.  ese different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can be your entire move. However you move, deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\nBREAKING UP YOUR MOVE\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some speed before and then the remainder a er your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\n\n39 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nCOMBAT STEP BY STEP\n1. Determine surprise.

Repeat step 4 until away and in what direction. the fighting stops.\n\n39 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nMOVING BETWEEN ATTACKS\nIf your action involves more than one weapon a ack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between a acks. For example, a fighter who can make two a acks with the Multia ack feature and has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an a ack, move 15 feet, and then a ack a different target.\nUSING DIFFERENT SPEEDS\nIf you have more than one speed, such as a walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between them during your move.  enever you switch, subtract \nthe distance you ve already moved from the new speed.  e result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can t use the new speed during the current move.\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet. If you wanted to walk any farther, you d be done for your move, but you could still leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\nDIFFICULT TERRAIN\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases the se ing of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.\nEvery foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot.  is rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain.  e space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.\nBEING PRONE\nCombatants o en find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in the Appendix.\nYou can drop prone freely, without using any speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.\nFor example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can t stand up if you don t have enough movement le  or if your speed is 0.\nTo move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\n\u000eMOVING AROUND OTHER CREATURES\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature s space. You can only move through a hostile creature s space if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature s space is difficult terrain for you.\n ether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can t willingly end your move in its space.\nIf you leave a hostile creature s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity a ack.\nFLYING MOVEMENT\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits, but they must \nalso deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held alo  by magic, such as by the fly spell.\nCREATURE SIZE\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space.  e \nSize Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat.\nObjects sometimes use the same size categories.\nSIZE CATEGORIES\nSIZE SPACE\nTiny 2½ by 2½ ft.\n Small                5 by 5 ft.\nMedium 5 by 5 ft.\n Large                10 by 10 ft. \nHuge 15 by 15 ft.\n Gargantuan           20 by 20 ft. or larger\nSPACE\nA space is the area in feet that a creature effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. \nA typical Medium creature isn t 5 feet wide, for example, but in a fight, it controls that space. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.\nA creature s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures \ncrowd around a Medium or smaller one, there s li le room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying40\nSQUEEZING INTO A SMALLER SPACE\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it.  us, a Large \ncreature can squeeze through a passage that s only 5 feet wide.  ile squeezing through a space, a creature must \nspend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on a ack rolls and DEX saves. A ack rolls against the creature have advantage while it s squeezing.\nACTIONS IN COMBAT\n en you take your action on your turn, you can take one \nof the actions presented here, an action gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have their own distinct actions in their \nstat blocks.\n en you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in \nthe rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\nATTACK\n e most common action in combat is the A ack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged a ack. See the Making an A ack section later in this chapter for rules that govern a acks.\nCertain features, such as the fighter s Multia ack, allow you to make more than one a ack with this action.\nCAST A SPELL\nSpellcasting characters, such as clerics and wizards, and some monsters can take the Cast a Spell action to cast a spell in combat. You can only cast spells this way if the spell has a casting time of 1 action. If a spell s casting time is longer than an action (minutes or hours) or a reaction, you can t take this action to cast it.\nDASH\n en you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement \nfor the current turn.  e increase equals your speed, \na er applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn with a Dash.\nDISENGAGE\n en you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn t provoke opportunity a acks for the rest of the turn.\n\u000eDODGE\n en you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding a acks. Until the start of your next turn, you make DEX saves with advantage and a ack rolls made against you have disadvantage if you can see the a acker. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in the Appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.\nHELP\n en you take the Help action, you lend aid to another creature to complete a task.  at creature gains advantage \non the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\nYou can also take the Help action to aid a friendly creature a ack a target within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or otherwise team up to make your ally s a ack \nmore effective. If your ally a acks the target before your next turn, they get advantage on their first a ack roll.\nHIDE\n en you take the Hide action, you make a DEX (Stealth) check in an a empt to hide, following the rules for hiding. \nIf you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the Unseen A ackers and Targets section in this chapter.\nREADY\n en you take the Ready action, you prepare to do \nsomething on another creature s turn using your reaction. \n is lets you get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. You must take your readied reaction before the start of your next turn.\nFirst, name a perceivable circumstance that triggers your reaction.  en, state the action or move you will take in response to that trigger. Examples include,  If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I ll pull the lever that opens it,  and \n If the goblin steps next to me, I move away. \n en the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right a er the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\nYou can ready a spell with the Ready action. You cast it as normal but hold its energy.  en, a er the trigger, you release it with your reaction. \nTo be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding the energy requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without \ntaking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on \nthe web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends. Furthermore, if you take damage before you release the readied magic missile, your concentration might be broken.\n\n41 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nSEARCH\n en you take the Search action, you devote your \na ention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a WIS (Perception) check or an INT (Investigation) check.\nUSE AN OBJECT\n en you take the Use an Object action, you focus specifically on that interaction. Since you can normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as drawing a sword as part of an a ack, this action is usually only needed when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn. If an object is complex or requires an ability check to use, the GM might require this action even if it s the only object you ve handled this turn.\nMAKING AN ATTACK\n ether you re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an a ack roll as part of a spell, an a ack has a simple structure.\n1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your a ack s range: a creature, an object, or a location.\n2. Determine modifiers.  e GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your a ack roll.\n3. Resolve the a ack. You make the a ack roll. On a hit, you roll damage unless the particular a ack has rules that specify otherwise. Some a acks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.\nIf there s ever any question whether something you re doing counts as an a ack, the rule is simple: if you re making an a ack roll, you re making an a ack.\nATTACK ROLLS\n en you make an a ack, your a ack roll determines whether the a ack hits or misses. To make an a ack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the check result equals or exceeds the target s AC, the a ack hits. \n( e AC for an NPC or monster is in its stat block.)\nMODIFIERS TO THE ROLL\n en a PC makes an a ack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character s PB.  en a monster makes an a ack roll, it \nuses the modifier provided for the action in its stat block.\nAbility Modifier.  e ability modifier for a melee weapon a ack is STR, and the ability modifier for a ranged weapon a ack is DEX. Weapons with the finesse or thrown property break this rule; see weapon property descriptions in chapter 3 for more on that.\nSome spells also require an a ack roll.  e ability \n\u000emodifier used for a spell a ack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.\nProficiency Bonus. Add your proficiency bonus to your a ack roll when you a ack using a weapon with which you have proficiency and any time you a ack with a spell.\nROLLING 1 OR 20\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\nIf the d20 roll for an a ack is a 20, the a ack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target s AC.  is is called a critical hit. See Critical Hits later in the chapter for more on this.\nIf the d20 roll for an a ack is a 1, the a ack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target s AC.\nUNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS\nCombatants can try to escape notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.\n en you a ack a target you can t see, you have disadvantage on the a ack roll.  is is true whether you re guessing at the target s location or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, though the GM might just say that you missed, not whether you guessed the target s location correctly.\n en a creature can t see you, you have advantage on \na ack rolls against it. If you are hidden both unseen and unheard when you make an a ack, you give away your location when the a ack hits or misses.\nCOVER\nWalls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target benefits from cover only when an a ack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\n ere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective cover applies. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.\nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and DEX saves. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body.  e obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.\nA target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and DEX saves. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle.  e obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\nA target with total cover can t be targeted directly by an \na ack or a spell, although some spells can reach a target with total cover by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying42\nRANGED ATTACKS\n en you make a ranged a ack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged a ack.\nRANGE\nYou can make ranged a acks only against targets within a specified range.\nIf a ranged a ack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can t a ack a target beyond this range.\nSome ranged a acks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges.  e smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your a ack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can t a ack a target beyond the long range.\nRANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT\nAiming a ranged a ack is more difficult when a foe is next to you.  en you make a ranged a ack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the a ack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn t incapacitated.\nMELEE ATTACKS\nA melee a ack allows you to a ack a foe within your reach. A melee a ack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee a ack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee a ack.\nMost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus a ack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee a ack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee a acks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon a ack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-bu , \nor similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your STR modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\nOPPORTUNITY ATTACKS\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance \nto strike an enemy who flees or passes by. Such a strike is called an opportunity a ack.\nYou can make an opportunity a ack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity a ack, use your reaction to make one melee a ack against the provoking creature.  e a ack \noccurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\n\u000eYou can avoid provoking an opportunity a ack by taking the Disengage action. You also don t provoke an opportunity a ack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don t provoke an opportunity a ack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\nTWO-WEAPON FIGHTING\n en you take the A ack action and a ack with a light \nmelee weapon held in one hand, you can use a bonus action to a ack with a different light melee weapon you hold in the other hand. You don t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus a ack, unless that modifier is negative.\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon instead of making a melee a ack with it.\nGRAPPLING\nUsing the A ack action, you can make a special melee \na ack to grapple a creature. If you can make multiple \na acks with the A ack action, this a ack replaces one of them.\n e target must be no more than one size larger than \nyou and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an a ack roll: a STR (Athletics) check contested by the target s STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses which check to use). If you win the contest, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see Appendix).  e condition specifies what ends it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. It must succeed on a STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check contested by your STR (Athletics) check.\nMoving a Grappled Creature.  en you move, you can \ndrag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\nSHOVING\nUsing the A ack action, you can make a special melee \na ack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you can make multiple a acks with the A ack action, this a ack replaces one of them.\n e target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an a ack roll, you make a STR (Athletics) check contested by the target s STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses which check to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.\n\n43 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nDAMAGE AND HEALING\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds.  e thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\nHIT POINTS\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill.  ose with fewer hit points are more fragile.\nA creature s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from its hit point maximum down to 0.  is number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\n enever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points.  e loss of hit points has no effect on a creature s capabilities until the creature drops to \n0 hit points.\nTEMPORARY HIT POINTS\nSome spells and special abilities give you temporary hit points. Don t add these to your current hit points. Instead, think of them as a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protects you from injury.\n en you have temporary hit points and take damage, \nlose the temporary hit points first. Any le over damage carries over to your current hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from \nyour current hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. You can be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can t restore temporary hit points, and you \ncan t stack temporary hit points together. If you have \na pool of temporary hit points and then get more from another source, decide whether to keep the ones you have or take the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. \n ey can still absorb damage directed at you while you re unconscious, but only true healing can stabilize you.\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has \na duration, they last until depleted or you finish a long rest.\nDAMAGE ROLLS\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant \n\u000ea bonus to damage. A penalty might cause you to deal 0 damage, but you never deal negative damage.\n en a acking with a weapon, add your ability \nmodifier the same modifier used for the a ack roll to \nthe damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball, the player rolls damage once for all creatures caught in the blast.\nCRITICAL HITS\n en you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice \nfor the a ack s damage against the target. Roll all of the \na ack s damage dice twice and add them together.  en \nadd any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all damage dice at once.\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, \nroll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add \nyour relevant ability modifier. If the a ack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue s Sneak A ack feature, roll those dice twice as well.\nDAMAGE TYPES\nDifferent a acks, damaging spells, and other harmful \neffects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\n e damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid.  e corrosive spray of a black dragon s breath and \nthe dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force a acks hammers, falling, constriction, and the like deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold.  e infernal chill radiating from an ice devil s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon s breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon s breath deal lightning damage.\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain Undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers ma er and even the soul.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling a acks, including \nspears and monsters  bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon s breath deal poison damage.\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal \npsychic damage.\n\nBlack Flag Roleplaying44\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric s flame strike spell or an angel s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters  claws deal slashing damage.\n under. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect \nof the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\nDAMAGE RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied a er all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an a ack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage.  e creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5.  e \n25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not \nreduced by three-quarters.\nHEALING\nUnless it results in death, damage isn t permanent. Rest \ncan restore a creature s hit points, and magical methods \nsuch as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\n en a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature s \nhit points can t exceed its hit point maximum, so any \nhit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. \nIf the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points, not 8.\nA creature that dies can t regain hit points until magic \nsuch as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\nDROPPING TO 0 HIT POINTS\n en you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\nINSTANT DEATH\nMassive damage can kill you instantly.  en damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\n\u000eFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an a ack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, and 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\nFALLING UNCONSCIOUS\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see Appendix).  is unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\nDEATH SAVES\n enever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special save, called a death save, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saves, this one isn t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a save.\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect \nby itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die.\nSuccesses and failures don t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.  e number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20.  en you make a death save and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death save failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\nSTABILIZING A CREATURE\n e best way to help a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn t killed by a failed death save.\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and a empt to stabilize it with a successful DC 10 WIS (Medicine) check.\nA stable creature doesn t make death saves, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.  e creature stops being stable, and must start making death saves again if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn t healed regains 1 hit point a er 1d4 hours.\nMONSTERS AND DEATH\nMonsters generally die the instant they drop to 0 hit points, since tracking death saves for a dozen monsters can be tedious.\nMighty villains and special NPCs are common exceptions, though.  e GM can decide to have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as PCs.\n\n45 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\nKNOCKING A CREATURE OUT UNDERWATER COMBAT Sometimes an a acker wants to incapacitate a foe rather \n en adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea than deal a killing blow.  en an a acker reduces a \nhomes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find creature to 0 hit points with a melee a ack, the a acker \nthemselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a can choose to knock the creature out instead of killing it. \nchallenging environment.

You can t mount it if you \ndon t have 15 feet of movement le  or if your speed is 0.\nIf an effect moves your mount against its will while you re \non it, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or fall off the \nmount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you re \nknocked prone while mounted, you must make the same \nsave with the same results.\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction \nto dismount and land on your feet as it falls. Otherwise, \nyou are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet \nof it.\nCONTROLLING A MOUNT\n ile you re mounted, you have two options. You can \neither control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, generally prefer to act independently.\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training.  e initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\nAn independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to devour a downed foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity a ack while you re on it, the a acker can target you or the mount."

        "\n\nCHAPTER 4: SPELLCASTING\nPotent energies permeate the universe. Magic is the manipulation of those energies to change reality. Those who can harness such energies are called spellcasters. Spellcasters are categorized into groups based on the source of their power. Regardless of sources, the laws that rule these reality-shaping effects, known as spells, are the same. This section outlines the rules of spellcasting and includes a selection of commonly seen spells.What is a Spell?A spell is a manipulation of reality accomplished using a combination of will and energy. Every spell must have energy to fuel its effects and a spellcaster capable of controlling the flow of energy. Spells can accomplish any number of things—harm, protection, problem-solving—all guided by a caster’s imagination.Creating a new spell is a work of extreme creativity and intense effort, often resulting from a lifetime of study. Because of this, most casters choose their spells from established pools of knowledge.\n\nCIRCLES OF MAGIC\nCircles of magic represent primary sources that fuel spellcaster abilities. This section details two circles of magic, arcane and divine, and explains their roles in spellcasting. \n\nARCANE CIRCLE\nThe arcane circle draws its power from manipulating measurable forces that govern material reality. This includes forces like heat, space, and gravity. An arcane caster uses a precise combination of words, gestures, and materials to ignite a roaring flame or link two locations hundreds of miles apart. Arcane magic is governed by an extensive set of rules and calculations, which a caster uses to enact effects. It can resemble a science more than mystical workings. Harnessing magic from this circle requires creativity, precision, and a drive for perfection.Black Flag Roleplaying 62\n\nSPELL RINGS\nEvery spell is categorized into a ring, ranked from 1st to 9th. Higher rings require more energy to fuel the spell and have stronger effects.Like the rings within a tree trunk, rings of magic encircle one another. A novice spellcaster starts at the center of the circle with access to the 1st ring. As they grow in ability, their powers expand toward the circle’s edge, giving access to more rings. The further a ring is from the center, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that ring’s spells.Each class provides a table of what spellcaster level you must achieve before you gain access to new spell rings. Typically, a spellcaster must be at least 17th level before they can cast spells from the 9th and final ring.\n\nSPELL SLOTS\nSpell slots are a measure of the energy a caster has to fuel their spells. Check the progression table for your spellcasting class to see how many spell slots your character has at a given level. As you gain levels, you gain new slots to cast spells from higher rings and more slots for spells from lower rings.A caster who has used all their spell slots is spent, physically and mentally. They’re out of energy for spells. To replenish spell slots, you must complete a short or long rest—each class specifies which type of rest and how many slots you regain. This rest represents the time needed to recover from the toll spellcasting takes on the body and mind.\n\nSCHOOLS OF MAGIC\nPractitioners and sages have attempted to quantify and categorize the complexities of magic into eight universally recognized categories known as spell schools. These schools have no inherent influence on a spell, but they help identify a spell’s effect. Specific class features or character abilities may refer to these schools. The eight schools are broadly explained in this section.\n\nABJURATION\nAbjuration spells use wards, shields, and other means of deflection to defend their target. Such spells might look like creating a force shield to block incoming missiles or imbuing a homestead with a ward to deter unwanted pests.\n\nCONJURATION\nConjuration spells restructure space, enabling objects, creatures, and other targets to be transported from place to place. Such spells might look like causing a lost house key to appear in your hand or creating a portal that allows for instantaneous travel to a far-flung realm of existence.\n\nDIVINATION\nDivination spells collect information, allowing a user to glean locations, outcomes, or sensory feedback beyond the limitations of standard perception. Such spells might look like sensing the location of a hidden entrance or receiving a vision of future events.\n\nENCHANTMENT\nEnchantment spells influence the minds of creatures, allowing a user to manipulate emotions or behavior.\n\nEVOCATION\nEvocation spells shape energy, allowing a user to channel healing, change air into roaring flame, or stir the skies into a raging storm.\n\nILLUSION\nIllusion spells deceive the senses, allowing a user to mask or alter the truth and create objects that seem real.\n\nNECROMANCY\nNecromancy spells manipulate life, allowing a user to use another’s life force to heal or reanimate the dead.\n\nTRANSMUTATION\nTransmutation spells alter the forms of creatures or objects, allowing a user to turn lead into gold or transform an enemy into a toad.\n\nKNOWN SPELLS\nA spellcaster must be extremely familiar with a spell or possess a magic item imbued with the spell to cast it. Each spellcasting class solves this familiarity issue differently.For example, a wizard catalogs their known spells in a spellbook and adds to it whenever they discover a new spell. Your character class defines how many spells you know and can potentially learn as you gain more class levels.\n\nPREPARED SPELLS\nA prepared spell is ready to cast quickly, in the heat of battle, without extensive reading or setup. Due to the intense mental fortitude necessary, the number of spells a caster can prepare at one time is generally limited.Some spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, must prepare all their spells ahead of time through study or meditation. Different spellcasting classes with shorter known spell lists can automatically prepare all their known spells.Your character class defines what you must do to prepare spells and how many spells you can have prepared at any given level.63 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting\n\nBONUS ACTION\nA spell cast with a bonus action is fast. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. If you use your bonus action to cast a spell from the 1st ring or higher on your turn, you can’t also use your action to cast a spell from the 1st ring or higher during the same turn.\n\nREACTION\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to specific triggering events. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description specifies the trigger required. \n\nLONGER CASTING TIMES\nCertain spells (particularly rituals) require more time to cast, minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting, and you must maintain concentration while you do so (see Concentration). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but the attempt doesn’t use a spell slot. To try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n\nRANGE\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is a point in space where the ball of fire erupts.Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.Spells that appear in cones or lines that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point must be you (see Area of Effect).Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range unless the spell’s description says otherwise.\n\nAREA OF EFFECT\nSpells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its origin. Usually, the origin is a point in space that you choose within the spell’s range, but some spells originate from a creature or an object.\n\nCANTRIPS\nSome spellcasters can employ a simple type of spell called a cantrip. A cantrip can be cast without using a spell slot and without being prepared. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the energy needed to produce the effect on demand. A cantrip’s spell ring is 0.Your class defines whether you can access cantrips, and how many cantrips you know at each class level.\n\nRITUALS\nRitual spells are uniquely powerful magic that takes 1 minute or longer to cast and often requires costly material components. A caster can only learn ritual spells associated with their circle of magic.Ritual spells don’t use spell slots. Otherwise, ritual spells follow normal spellcasting rules.Your character class defines whether you can access ritual spells, and how many rituals you know at each class level.\n\nCASTING IN ARMOR\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with any armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and hampered for spellcasting.\n\nCOMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS\nThe effects of different spells combine while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect, such as the highest bonus from multiple castings, applies while their durations overlap.For example, if two wizards cast mage armor on the same target, that target gains the spell’s benefit only once; they don’t get multiple AC bonuses.Elements of A SpellWhen a character casts a spell, the basic rules are the same regardless of the spell ring or its circle.Each spell in this chapter includes basic information, including the spell’s name, ring, circle, school, casting time, range, required components, and duration. Every spell also contains a description of its effect.\n\nCASTING TIME\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some can be accomplished in a shorter or longer span.Black Flag Roleplaying 64A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from its origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these straight lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\n\nCONE\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect unless you decide otherwise.\n\nCUBE\nYou select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect unless you decide otherwise.\n\nCYLINDER\nA cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.\n\nLINE\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect unless you decide otherwise.\n\nSPHERE\nYou select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.\n\nCOMPONENTS\nA spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you can’t cast the spell.\n\nVERBAL (V)\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\nSOMATIC (S)\nSpellcasting might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of motions. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\n\nMATERIAL (M)\nCasting some spells requires specific objects detailed in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in Equipment) in place of the components specified for a spell. However, if a cost is indicated for a component, a pouch or focus can’t substitute for it. The character must have that specific component to cast the spell.If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can be the same hand that they use to perform somatic components.\n\nDURATION\nA spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\nINSTANTANEOUS\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n\nCONCENTRATION\nSome spells require concentration to keep the magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its duration entry, and it specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:• Casting another spell that requires concentration.You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.65 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting• Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a CON save to maintain your concentration. The DC of this save equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate save for each source of damage.• Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a CON save to maintain concentration on a spell.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nEach spell includes a description of its effects, including key information about how the spell works.\n\nTARGETS\nA typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described in the Area of Effect section).Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n\nA CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGET\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and the point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\n\nTARGETING YOURSELF\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\n\nSPELL SAVES\nMany spells specify that a target can make a save to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.The DC to resist a spell equals 8 + the caster's spellcasting ability modifier + the caster's PB + any special modifiers.\n\nSPELL ATTACK ROLLS\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. A caster's attack bonus with a spell attack equals their spellcasting ability modifier + their PB.Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.Spell ListsThis section lists the spells available to casters of the various circles of magic. The list is organized by circle, then by spell ring. Each spell also belongs to a school of magic, which is identified in parentheses after the spell’s name.\n\nARCANE CIRCLE SPELL LIST\nThese spells are available to casters who draw power from the arcane circle. \n\nCANTRIPS\nAcid Splash (Conjuration)Dancing Lights (Evocation)Fire Bolt (Evocation)Grave Touch (Necromancy)Light (Evocation)Mage Hand (Conjuration)Mending (Transmutation)Message (Transmutation)Minor Illusion (Illusion)Poison Spray (Conjuration)Prestidigitation (Transmutation)Ray of Frost (Evocation)Shocking Grasp (Evocation)True Strike (Divination)\n\n1ST RING\nBurning Hands (Evocation)Charm Person (Enchantment)Color Spray (Illusion)Comprehend Languages (Divination)Detect Magic (Divination)Disguise Self (Illusion)Expeditious Retreat (Transmutation)False Life (Necromancy)Feather Fall (Transmutation)Fire under the Tongue (Transmutation)Floating Disk (Conjuration)Fog Cloud (Conjuration)Grease (Conjuration)Hideous Laughter (Enchantment)Longstrider (Transmutation)Mage Armor (Abjuration)Magic Missile (Evocation)Protection from Evil and Good (Abjuration)Shield (Abjuration)Silent image (Illusion)Black Flag Roleplaying 66Sleep (Enchantment)Thunderwave (Evocation)\n\n2ND RING\nAcid Arrow (Evocation)Blindness/Deafness (Necromancy)Blur (Illusion)Continual Flame (Evocation)Darkness (Evocation)Darkvision (Transmutation)Detect Thoughts (Divination)Elemental Blade (Evocation)Enlarge/Reduce (Transmutation)Flaming Sphere (Conjuration)Gear Barrage (Conjuration)Gentle Repose (Necromancy)Gust of Wind (Evocation)Hold Person (Enchantment)Invisibility (Illusion)Knock (Transmutation)Levitate (Transmutation)Locate Object (Divination)Magic Weapon (Transmutation)Mirror Image (Illusion)Misty Step (Conjuration)Ray of Enfeeblement (Necromancy)Rope Trick (Transmutation)Scorching Ray (Evocation)See Invisibility (Divination)Shatter (Evocation)Spider Climb (Transmutation)Suggestion (Enchantment)Web (Conjuration)\n\n3RD RING\nBlink (Transmutation)Counterspell (Abjuration)Dispel Magic (Abjuration)Fear (Illusion)Fireball (Evocation)Fly (Transmutation)Gaseous Form (Transmutation)Haste (Transmutation)Hypnotic Pattern (Illusion)Lightning Bolt (Evocation)Major Image (Illusion)Nondetection (Abjuration)Protection from Energy (Abjuration)Sending (Evocation)Slow (Transmutation)Stinking Cloud (Conjuration)Tongues (Divination)Vampiric Touch (Necromancy)Water Breathing (Transmutation)\n\nARCANE CIRCLE RITUAL LIST\nThese rituals are available to casters who draw power from the arcane circle.\n\n1ST RING\nAlarm (Abjuration)Create Familiar (Transmutation)Identify (Divination)Illusory Script (Illusion)Unseen Servant (Conjuration)\n\n2ND RING\nArcane Lock (Abjuration)Arcanist’s Magic Aura (Illusion)Magic Mouth (Illusion)\n\n3RD RING\nAnimate Dead (Necromancy)Clairvoyance (Divination)Glyph of Warding (Abjuration)Magic Circle (Abjuration)Phantom Steed (Illusion)Tiny Hut (Evocation)\n\nDIVINE CIRCLE SPELL LIST\nThese spells are available to casters who draw power from the divine circle. \n\nCANTRIPS\nGuidance (Divination)Light (Evocation)Mending (Transmutation)Resistance (Abjuration)Sacred Flame (Evocation)Spare the Dying (Necromancy)Thaumaturgy (Transmutation)\n\n1ST RING\nBane (Enchantment)Bless (Enchantment)Command (Enchantment)Cure Wounds (Evocation)Detect Evil and Good (Divination)Guiding Bolt (Evocation)Healing Word (Evocation)Inflict Wounds (Necromancy)Protection from Evil and Good (Abjuration)Purify Food and Drink (Transmutation)Sanctuary (Abjuration)Shield of Faith (Abjuration)\n\n2ND RING\nAid (Abjuration)Blindness/Deafness (Necromancy)Calm Emotions (Enchantment)Find Traps (Divination)Gear Barrage (Conjuration)Gentle Repose (Necromancy)Hold Person (Enchantment)Lesser Restoration (Abjuration)Locate Object (Divination)Protection from Poison (Abjuration)Silence (Illusion)Spiritual Weapon (Evocation)Warding Bond (Abjuration)Zone of Truth (Enchantment)\n\n3RD RING\nBeacon of Hope (Abjuration)Bestow Curse (Necromancy)Create Food and Water (Conjuration)Daylight (Evocation)Dispel Magic (Abjuration)Mass Healing Word (Evocation)Protection from Energy (Abjuration)Remove Curse (Abjuration)Revivify (Necromancy)Sending (Evocation)Speak with Dead (Necromancy)Spirit Guardians (Conjuration)Tongues (Divination)\n\nDIVINE CIRCLE RITUAL LIST\nThese rituals are available to casters who draw power from the divine circle.\n\n1ST RING\nDetect Poison and Disease (Divination)\n\n2ND RING\nAugury (Divination)Prayer of Healing (Evocation)\n\n3RD RING\nAnimate Dead (Necromancy)Clairvoyance (Divination)Glyph of Warding (Abjuration)Magic Circle (Abjuration)67 Chaptier 4: SpellcastingSpell DescriptionsThis section presents a small sampling of spells commonly used.

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.\n\nACID SPLASH\nArcane Cantrip (Conjuration)Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V, SDuration: InstantaneousYou conjure a glob of acid to burst over your targets.Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a DEX save or take 1d6 acid damage.This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level.\n\nAID\n2nd-Ring Divine (Abjuration)Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)Duration: 8 hoursYou bless allies with heightened vitality and newfound determination.Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve.

Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on WIS saves and death saves, and regains the maximum number of hit points possible from any healing.\n\nBESTOW CURSE\n3rd-Ring Divine (Necromancy)Casting Time: 1 actionRange: TouchComponents: V, SDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minuteWith a simple touch, you inflict a creature with a weakness of your choosing. You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a WIS save or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:• Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saves made with that ability score.• While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.• While cursed, the target must make a WIS save at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.• While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.Black Flag Roleplaying 68A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the GM’s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an INT modifier of -4 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a WIS save. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an INT check contested by your INT check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an INT modifier of −4 or less or one that doesn’t speak any language.Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.Black Flag Roleplaying 72\n\nDISGUISE SELF\n1st-Ring Arcane (Illusion)Casting Time: 1 actionRange: SelfComponents: V, SDuration: 1 hourYou wear an illusion that makes your appearance seem different.You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person— look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an INT (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\n\nDISPEL MAGIC\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Abjuration)Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 120 feetComponents: V, SDuration: InstantaneousYou break a spell’s power, ending its effects.Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range.

When the blade appears, you decide whether it deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage.You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the elemental blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 damage of the chosen type. The elemental blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\n\nENLARGE/REDUCE\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minuteYou change one target’s size, dramatically shrinking or expanding its shape.You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a CON save. On a success, the spell has no effect. If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.Enlarge. The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category— from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on STR checks and STR saves. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.Reduce. The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on STR checks and STR saves.

A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm or glyph of warding spells, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.\n\nFIREBALL\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Evocation)Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 30 feetComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)Duration: InstantaneousYou hurl a small ball of flame that explodes in a huge conflagration.A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.

You can ingest a nonmagical fire up to the size of a Small campfire within range. The fire is stored harmlessly in your mouth and dissipates without effect if it is not expelled before the spell ends.Once ingested, you can spit out the stored fire as an action. If you try to hit a particular target with the flames, treat this as a ranged attack with a range of 5 feet. Small campfire-sized flames deal 2d6 fire damage, while Tiny torch-sized flames deal 1d6 fire damage. Once you have spit out the flames, the fire goes out immediately unless it hits flammable material that can keep it fed.\n\nFLAMING SPHERE\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Conjuration)Casting Time: 1 actionRange: 60 feetComponents: V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minuteYou conjure a roiling ball of flame that acts on your command.A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration.

If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes, and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.\n\nFLY\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)Casting Time: 1 actionRange: TouchComponents: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutesWith an arcane phrase and a touch, you grant the power of flight.You touch a willing creature.

On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell.

The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit.

Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.The target must make a WIS save. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration.

Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a DEX save.

The Rituals are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nALARM\n1st-Ring Arcane Ritual (Abjuration)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 30 feetComponents: V, S, M (a silver hand bell worth 10 gp)Duration: 8 hoursLines of magic flare and fade, outlining a warded area you choose.You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.If you perform this ritual a second time before the duration of the first alarm spell has ended, the first alarm immediately ends.\n\nANIMATE DEAD\n3rd-Ring Arcane and Divine Ritual (Necromancy)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 10 feetComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, a pinch of bone dust, and a bloodstone worth at least 10 gp)Duration: InstantaneousYou give the remains of the dead new unlife, crafting a servant out of bones, flesh, and your will.This spell creates an Undead servant.

The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.If you attempt to cast this spell again while servants created by the first casting are still active, the servants created from the first casting are immediately destroyed.As you unlock higher rings, this ritual grows in potency. Once you have access to 4th ring spell slots or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.\n\nARCANE LOCK\n2nd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Abjuration)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: TouchComponents: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)Duration: Until dispelledYou lock a targeted object, making it difficult to bypass.You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration.

Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.\n\nARCANIST’S MAGIC AURA\n2nd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Illusion)Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: TouchComponents: V, S, M (a small square of silk and burning incense worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)Duration: 24 hoursYou drape your target in an illusory aura, masking its true nature beneath layers of misleading magic.89 Chaptier 4: SpellcastingYou place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.False Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.Mask. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type.\n\nAUGURY\n2nd-Ring Divine Ritual (Divination)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: SelfComponents: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)Duration: InstantaneousYou attempt to discern the outcome of your own plans.By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:Weal, for good resultsWoe, for bad resultsWeal and woe, for both good and bad resultsNothing, for results that aren’t especially good or badThe spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.\n\nCLAIRVOYANCE\n3rd-Ring Arcane and Divine Ritual (Divination)Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: 1 mileComponents: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou conjure a small sphere through which you can spy and sense nearby locations. You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.\n\nCREATE FAMILIAR\n1st-Ring Arcane Ritual (Transmutation)Casting Time: 1 hourRange: 5 feetComponents: V, S, M (A life-sized statue, puppet, stuffed animal, or other suitable vessel worth at least 10 gp)Duration: InstantaneousYou construct a facsimile of a helpful animal pet to act as your aide and companion.

Upon completion of the ritual, your familiar appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is considered a Construct rather than a Beast for any relevant spells or effects.Bound in Blood. When your familiar first appears, your hit point maximum decreases by one. If you permanently dismiss your familiar or it is otherwise permanently destroyed, you hit point maximum returns to normal. This reduction can’t be offset by any means as long as your familiar lives.Communicating with Your Familiar. While your familiar is on the same plane or realm of existence as you, it can magically convey what it sees or senses to you, and you can Black Flag Roleplaying 90communicate with it telepathically.Controlling Your Familiar. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.When you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you to do so, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your spell attack modifier for the roll.As an action, you can touch your familiar to reincorporate it into your body. When you do so, it melds into your skin, where it awaits your summons. While it is incorporated, you can use an action to expel it from your body, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.Destroying Your Familiar. If a familiar drops to 0 hit points, its body is instantly destroyed. If you still live, your familiar regrows a new body in 1 hour, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you die, your familiar is permanently destroyed, and the ritual must be performed again to create a new familiar. At any time, you can use an action to permanently dismiss your familiar, which instantly destroys it. You can have only one arcane familiar at a time. If you attempt to cast this spell while your current familiar still lives, the ritual fails.\n\nDETECT POISON AND DISEASE\n1st-Ring Divine Ritual (Divination)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: SelfComponents: V, S, M (a yew leaf)Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou sense nearby toxic creatures and substances.For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nGLYPH OF WARDING\n3rd-Ring Arcane and Divine Ritual (Abjuration)Casting Time: 1 hourRange: TouchComponents: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)Duration: Until dispelled or triggeredYou ward a small area with a near-invisible mark.When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful INT (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect Aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a DEX save. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed save (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd ring or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n\nIDENTIFY\n1st-Ring Arcane Ritual (Divination)91 Chaptier 4: SpellcastingCasting Time: 1 minuteRange: TouchComponents: V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)Duration: InstantaneousYou divine an object’s purpose and properties and what magic is affecting it.You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.\n\nILLUSORY SCRIPT\n1st-Ring Arcane Ritual (Illusion)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: TouchComponents: V, S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)Duration: 10 daysYou scribe an illusion of false, hidden, or indiscernible script that lasts for a tenday.You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, it appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.\n\nMAGIC CIRCLE\n3rd-Ring Arcane and Divine Ritual (Abjuration)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 10 feetComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)Duration: 1 hourYou ring a small location with warding magic and arcane runes, barring access for certain types of foes.You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:• The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a CHA save.• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.• Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.\n\nMAGIC MOUTH\n2nd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Illusion)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 30 feetComponents: V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)Duration: Until dispelledYou enchant an object to deliver a short message when the time is right.You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth.When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.Black Flag Roleplaying 92\n\nPHANTOM STEED\n3rd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Illusion)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: 30 feetComponents: V, SDuration: 1 hourYou conjure a swift, fragile mount.A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it, if the steed takes any damage, or you cast this spell to summon a different steed.\n\nPRAYER OF HEALING\n2nd-Ring Divine Ritual (Evocation)Casting Time: 10 minutesRange: 30 feetComponents: V Duration: InstantaneousYou spend ten minutes beseeching for aid to be visited upon you and your living allies.Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

Once you have access to 3rd-ring spell slots or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each spell ring above 3rd.\n\nTINY HUT\n3rd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Evocation)Casting Time: 1 minuteRange: Self (10-foot radius hemisphere)Components: V, S, M (a small crystal bead)Duration: 8 hoursA protective dome springs up around you, a refuge for you and those close to you.A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark.

The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, a STR modifier of −4, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.If you cast this spell again while a servant created by the first casting is still active, the servant created from the first casting is immediately destroyed.93 Chaptier 4: SpellcastingAdditional Spell DescriptionsThis section presents additional primordial or wyrd spells (and one ritual).

        "Adventuring is a section that covers the various rules that come with exploring the world and some important ways PCs interact with the environment.\n\nTIME\nIn the passage of time matters, the GM determines how long a task takes. Talking about the passage of time depends on what characters are trying to do and where they're trying to do it. In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time in which every participant gets a turn. In a dungeon environment, outside of combat, movement more often happens on a scale of minutes. It might take a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good 10 minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable. In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time. For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road between cities, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey. A GM should always feel free to shift between these scales to match what's happening in the game and to keep things moving at the table.\n\nMOVEMENT AND TRAVEL\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope – all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures. The GM can summarize movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\" Sometimes though, it's important to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. Rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.\n\nSPEED\nEvery creature has a speed, the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in a life-threatening situation. When the situation is less dire, the following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nTRAVEL PACE\nWhile traveling, a party can move at a fast, normal, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far they can move in a period of time for their pace and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully. Forced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push beyond that limit at the risk of exhaustion. For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a CON save at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed save, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see Appendix). Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is rare except in densely populated areas. Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n\nTRAVEL PACE\n\n\n                DISTANCE TRAVELED PER . . . \n\n\n                PACE MINUTE HOUR DAY                                         EFFECT\n−5 penalty to Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles Perception score Normal        300 feet        3 miles     24 miles        —Slow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles Able to use Stealth\n\nDIFFICULT TERRAIN\nThe travel speeds given on the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. However, adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground – all considered difficult terrain. You move at half speed in difficult terrain – moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed – so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nSPECIAL TYPES OF MOVEMENT\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\n\nCLIMBING, SWIMMING, AND CRAWLING\nWhile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful STR (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful STR (Athletics) check.\n\nJUMPING\nYour STR determines how far you can jump. Long Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to half your walking speed if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. Then you make a standing long jump, you can leap only a quarter of your walking speed. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At the GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 STR (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it. When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone. High Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your STR modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. Then you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a STR (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can. You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1/2 times your height. \n\nFALLING\nA fall from a great height is a common hazard for an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature lands prone and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell to a maximum of 20d6 unless it has a feature or ability that allows it to avoid taking damage from the fall.\n\nSUFFOCATING\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its CON modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its CON modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. For example, a creature with a CON modifier of +2 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\n\nVISION AND LIGHT\nThe fundamental tasks of adventuring – noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few – rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance. A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on WIS (Perception) checks that rely on sight. A heavily obscured area, such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage, blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see Appendix) when trying to see something in that area. The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness. Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days can provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light. Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical darkness.\n\nDARKVISION\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\nKEENSENSE\nA creature with keensense can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as Oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\n\nTRUESIGHT\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saves against them, and perceive the true form of a creature with the shapechanger tag or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\n\nFOOD AND WATER\nCharacters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see Appendix). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\n\nFOOD\nA character needs one pound of food per day. You can make food last longer by eating half rations. Eating half rations in a day counts as half a day without food. A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + CON modifier (minimum 1). Beyond that, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of each day. One normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\n\nWATER\nA character needs one gallon of water per day or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. If the character already has at least one level of exhaustion, the character suffers two levels each day with little or no water.\n\nINTERACTING WITH OBJECTS\nA character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what if anything happens. For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a STR check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task (see Determining DC earlier in this chapter). Characters can also damage objects with weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison damage, but otherwise, they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object's AC and HP and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks – it's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example. Objects always fail STR and DEX saves, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. Then an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks. A character can also attempt a STR check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\n\nSTATISTICS FOR OBJECTS\nGiven enough time, it's safe to assume that a PC can (and will) destroy most breakable objects. In these cases, the GM decides what a PC can reasonably accomplish. For example, it is reasonable to say a fighter can never cut through a stone wall with a sword but can chop a candle in half in the time it takes to talk about it. However, when time is a factor – like cutting through the ropes of a bridge before a horde of angry goblins charges across – giving objects some statistics helps everyone understand what's achievable. In these situations, use the following rules to determine an object's armor class and hit points. Armor Class. An object's AC is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object by striking it. The object can't dodge, but its AC represents its material resilience. The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\n\nOBJECT ARMOR CLASS\n\n\n SUBSTANCE                     AC                      SUBSTANCE               AC\nCloth, paper, rope 11 Iron, steel 19 Crystal, glass, ice         13                    Mithral               21Wood, bone 15 Adamantine 23 Stone                       17\n\nINTERACTING WITH OBJECTS AROUND YOU\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of things you can do during your move or your action:• Draw or sheathe a sword• Open or close a door• Get a potion from your backpack• Pick up a dropped weapon• Take a bauble from a table• Remove a ring from your finger• Stuff some food into your mouth• Plant a banner in the ground• Fish a few coins from your belt pouch• Drink all the ale in a flagon• Throw a lever or a switch• Pull a torch from a sconce• Extinguish a small flame• Don a mask• Pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head• Put your ear to a door• Kick a small stone• Turn a key in a lock• Tap the floor with a 10-foot pole• Hand an item to another character\n\nHit Points. An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Whether an object is fragile or resilient is up to the GM. Large objects tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking any small part of it breaks the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit point amounts for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\n\nOBJECT HIT POINTS\n\n\n SIZE                                                 FRAGILE         RESILIENT\nTiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4) Small (chest, lute)                               3 (1d6)        10 (3d6)Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8) Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window)             5 (1d10)       27 (5d10)Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, though it might be simpler to decide how long the object can withstand whatever force is acting against it and track 37 Chaptier 2: Playing the Gamethat. If you do track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections and track each section separately. Destroying a smaller section could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 HP.\n\nObjects and Damage Types. Objects are immune to poison damage. You might decide some damage types are more or less effective against a particular object or substance. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire. As always, use good judgment and let the GM make the call.\n\nDamage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold ignores any single attack that deals damage less than its damage threshold. For example, if a wall has a damage threshold of 10, attacks that deal 9 or less damage to it deal no damage at all.\n\nRESTING\nHeroic though they might be, adventurers need rest time to sleep, eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. Adventurers can take short rests during an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.\n\nSHORT REST\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. You can spend one or more hit dice at the end of a short rest, up to your maximum number of hit dice (which is equal to your character's level). For each hit die spent in this way, roll the die and add your character's CON modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional hit die after each roll. You regain some spent hit dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.\n\nLONG REST\nA long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity – at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity – the character must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, you regain all lost hit points. You also regain spent hit dice, up to half of your maximum (minimum of 1). For example, if your character has 8 hit dice, you regain 4 of them upon finishing a long rest. A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits."

But whenever a PC a empts something remarkable, where there is the potential to fail, it s time to roll the dice. Your character s ability modifiers and proficiencies can increase your chances of success, along with other factors covered here. is section describes how dice rolls are used to determine success or failure. It outlines the stages of making a roll and how a roll may be affected by character capabilities or external circumstances.\\n\\nMAKING CHECKS\\nMost dice rolls in the Black Flag Roleplaying game are checks. All checks involve rolling a 20-sided die called a d20. To make a check, roll a d20 to determine your starting number.  en add one of the ability modifiers on your character sheet. Finally, if you are proficient in something relevant to the roll, add your proficiency bonus (PB).  e total of those numbers is your check result.Check FormulaCheck Result = d20 + Ability Modifier + PB (If you have a relevant proficiency) \\n\\nSTAGES OF A CHECK\\n   Player describes the task they want to accomplish.   GM decides if a check is needed. If not, play continues. If a check is needed, proceed to next step.   GM declares what kind of check is needed, including which ability modifier it uses and what proficiencies  are relevant.\\x0e   GM determines if the check is being made with advantage or disadvantage.   Player rolls a d20 (or two d20s if they have advantage or disadvantage).   Player adds their ability modifier and PB (if they have a relevant proficiency) to the number rolled to determine their check result.   If desired, a PC spends Luck points to increase the check result.   GM compares the check result to the check DC and declares whether the check succeeds or fails.\\n\\nABILITY MODIFIERS\\nAll checks in the game are tied to one of the six ability modifiers Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Wisdom (WIS), Intelligence (INT), or Charisma (CHA). You add one of these six ability modifiers to every check.  e rules typically dictate which modifier you must use for a particular check, but in cases where no ability is listed, the GM decides which one is relevant. For more information about applying ability modifiers to checks, see the  ich Ability Modifier? sidebar.\\n\\nPROFICIENCY BONUS\\nAll PCs have a proficiency bonus determined by their level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. Only add your PB to a die roll or DC once. For example, if two different rules allow you to add your PB to a WIS save, you may add it only once.Occasionally, you might double or halve your PB before you add it. If some circumstance suggests that your PB applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and double or halve it only once.If your PB doesn t apply to a roll, doubling doesn t change that. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your PB when you make INT (History) checks.29 Chaptier 2: Playing the GameIn general, don t double your PB for a ack rolls or saves.  en you have advantage or disadvantage and a rule lets If some feature or effect allows you to do so, the above rules  you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You still apply. choose which one. For example, if you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and roll a 1 and a 13, you DETERMINING SUCCESS OR FAILUREcould reroll the 1 or the 13, but not both.You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the In most cases, you measure your check result against a  use of special abilities, actions, or spells. You can also use target number the GM sets for you, called a difficulty class  Luck points to grant advantage. Finally, the GM can decide (DC). If your check result is equal to or higher than the  that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the DC, your roll succeeds! If it s less than the DC, you fail.other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a DETERMINING DC situational call.Black Flag Roleplaying30Most of the time, the rules tell the GM what a DC should be. For example, a PC must get a check result of 19 or higher to successfully a ack a creature with an AC 19 (AC is one example of a pre-determined DC). en the rules don t provide a DC, the GM gets to set an appropriate number. If you re the GM and you aren t sure, think about how hard you want a task to be.  en consult the Typical Difficulty Class table to assign a number. You can always set it at a number that isn t divisible by 5.\\n\\nTYPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASS\\n\\n\\nDIFFICULTY DC\\nHigh Chance of Success 10 or less Moderate Chance of Success                          15Low Chance of Success 20 Almost No Chance of Success                         25 or higher\\n\\n\\x0eLUCK\\nEvery PC has a special resource called Luck. Use Luck to influence the result of any ability check, a ack roll, or save you make.\\n\\nSPENDING LUCK POINTS\\nSpend Luck points on a 1-for-1 bonus to add to any d20 roll you make. For example, if you have 4 Luck points, and roll a 13 on the die, you could spend 2 Luck points and make your result a 15. You then have 2 Luck points to use later. You can t use Luck points to offset the effects of rolling a natural 1 or create the effects of a natural 20. No one is that lucky.Alternatively, immediately a er you make an ability check, a ack roll, or save, you can spend 3 Luck points to reroll a single d20 used for that roll.Black Flag Roleplaying30\\n\\nADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGEGAINING LUCK POINTS\\nSometimes special circumstances allow you to roll a  en you create your character, you start with 0 Luck check with advantage or force you to roll a check with  points. You gain Luck points in the following ways: disadvantage.    Once per turn, when you fail an a ack roll or save, gain Rolling with advantage means you roll two d20s, then  1 Luck point. use the higher of the two numbers to calculate your check    e GM can award 1 Luck point to a character as a result.  reward for coming up with a clever idea, excellent Rolling with disadvantage means you roll two d20s,   roleplaying, or trying something interesting but not then use the lower of the two numbers to calculate your  optimal.check result.    e GM can award Luck points to a party for surviving For example, if you have advantage and roll a 17 and a 5,  difficult encounters or achieving story goals (in you use the 17. If you instead have disadvantage, use the 5. addition to XP).If two or more favorable situations grant advantage, you still roll only one additional d20. Same goes for  LOSING LUCK POINTSdisadvantage. You only ever roll a maximum of two d20s.A PC may have a maximum of 5 Luck points at one time. If If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and your PC has 5 Luck points and would gain a sixth, you must disadvantage, they cancel each other out, and you roll only immediately roll a d4 and reset your Luck points to the die one d20.  is works no ma er how many circumstances result.impose disadvantage or grant advantage. If they conflict at all, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.Black Flag Roleplaying30\\n\\nTHE THREE TYPES OF CHECKS\\nBlack Flag  rules have three types of checks. All use the same core mechanics described in the Making Checks section, but each is used in different circumstances and has different rules around whether you add your PB to the check result. Each type of check is described in greater detail here.\\n\\nATTACK ROLLS\\nA ack rolls are checks used almost exclusively during combat for a acking. For a full rundown on a ack rolls, refer to the Combat section later in this chapter.\\n\\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\\nIf you have proficiency with the weapon you re using (simple or martial), add your PB to the a ack roll.\\n\\nSAVES\\nSaves are checks made to resist or avoid threats from spells, traps, poisons, diseases, or similar hazards. You don t normally decide to make a save; the GM asks you to make one because your character is at risk of harm.To make a save, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For instance, use your DEX modifier for a DEX save. e DC for a save is determined by the effect that calls for it. As an example, when you make a save against a spell, the DC is determined by the caster s spellcasting ability and PB. e result of a successful or failed save is described in the effect a er its DC.A successful save usually means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\\n\\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\\nYour character class gives you proficiency in at least two saves based on which ability modifiers are useful for the class.  e wizard, for example, is proficient in INT and WIS saves. Add your PB to saves according to your class.\\n\\nABILITY CHECKS\\n en you want to do something that isn t covered by an a ack roll or save, make an ability check. Since ability checks cover a wide range of tasks, they are slightly more complex than the other two types of checks.To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success. You overcome the challenge. Otherwise, it s a failure. You make no progress toward the objective, or you make some progress but also suffer a setback, as determined by the GM.\\n\\n\\x0eCONTESTS\\nSometimes your efforts are directly opposed by someone else.  is can occur when multiple creatures try to do the same thing but only one can succeed, such as snatching a magic ring falling to the floor. It can also occur when one creature tries to prevent another one from accomplishing a goal for example, a monster might try to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.Every participant in a contest makes an ability check. Apply appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, compare the check results.  e participant with the highest check result wins the contest and either succeeds at the action or prevents other participants from succeeding.If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same.  us, one participant might win by default. If two creatures tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep it closed, a tie means that the door stays shut.\\n\\nPASSIVE CHECKS\\nA passive check doesn t involve any die rolls.  is kind of ability check can represent an average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again. Or a GM can use it to secretly determine whether a PC succeeds at something the player doesn t know to try to do, such as noticing a hidden monster.A passive check total is called a score. Here s how to determine a character s passive score:   10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check.   If the character has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. So, for example, if a 1st-level character has a WIS +2 ability modifier and is proficient in the Perception skill, they have a passive Perception score of 14 (10 + 2 for WIS + 2 for PB).\\n\\nWORKING TOGETHER\\nSometimes two or more creatures team up on a job.  e creature with the highest ability modifier is designated the lead for the effort.  at creature can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help given by the others. In combat, this requires the Help action.A creature can only provide help if they have capacity to do the task. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves  tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can t work together on a lock-picking job. Moreover, a character can help only when their assistance would be productive.  reading a needle doesn t get any easier with another pair of hands.31 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\\n\\nGROUP CHECKS\\n en a number of individuals try to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group check. In this case, characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren t.To make a group check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the members succeed (round up), the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.Group checks don t come up o en, and they re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers navigate a swamp, the GM might call for a WIS (Survival) group check to see if the whole party can avoid quicksand, sinkholes, and other hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters can guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into a hazard.\\n\\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\\nTwo main types of proficiencies can modify an ability check.Tool ProficienciesA tool helps you do something you couldn t otherwise do, such as repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents can give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your PB to any ability check you make using that tool.Tool use is not tied to a single ability modifier.  e check depends on what you re trying to do, at the GM s discretion. For example, when using woodcarver s tools, the GM might ask you to make a DEX check to carve out fine detail or a STR check to make something out of particularly hard wood.Skill ProficienciesEvery PC starts the game with skill proficiencies granted by their background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents. Proficiency in a skill means you can add your PB to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, you don t add your PB to ability checks.For example, if a character a empts to climb a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a STR (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the player rolls a d20, adds their character s STR modifier and then adds PB. If the character lacks that proficiency, the player rolls a d20 and adds only their character s STR modifier. e rules in a scenario usually prompt a GM to ask for an ability check using a specific skill for example,  Make a WIS (Perception) check.  Sometimes though, more than one skill might reasonably apply to a situation. A player can ask the GM if a different skill is relevant to the check. If the GM agrees, the PC can try a skill they re more proficient in!\\n\\n\\x0eSKILL DESCRIPTIONS\\n e skill descriptions here explain the different ways you can use the skill.\\n\\nACROBATICS\\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX)Your DEX (Acrobatics) check covers your a empt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as running across a sheet of ice, balancing on a tightrope, or staying upright on a rocking ship s deck.  e GM might also call for a DEX (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\\n\\nANIMAL HANDLING\\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS) en you want to calm a domesticated animal, keep a mount from ge ing spooked, or intuit an animal s intentions, the GM might call for a WIS (Animal Handling) check. You also make a WIS (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you try something risky.\\n\\nARCANA\\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)Your INT (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and inhabitants of those planes.\\n\\nATHLETICS\\nAssociated Ability: Strength (STR)Your STR (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include:Climbing a sheer or slippery cliff, avoiding hazards while scaling a wall, or clinging to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.Jumping an unusually long distance or pulling off a stunt midjump.Swimming or staying afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or a creature tries to pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\\n\\nDECEPTION\\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA)Your CHA (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, verbally or through your actions.  is deception ranges from misleading through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, cheat at gambling, wear a convincing disguise, dull suspicions with false assurances, or smile genuinely while telling a complete whopper.Black Flag Roleplaying32\\n\\nHISTORY\\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)Your INT (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\\n\\nINSIGHT\\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)Your WIS (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone s next move.  is involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\\n\\nINTIMIDATION\\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA) en you a empt to influence someone through threats, hostility, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a CHA (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down, or using a broken bo le to suggest that a sneering vizier reconsider.\\n\\nINVESTIGATION\\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT) en you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an INT (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an INT (Investigation) check.\\n\\nMEDICINE\\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)A WIS (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\\n\\nNATURE\\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)Your INT (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\\n\\nPERCEPTION\\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)Your WIS (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to overhear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or catch the scent of monsters moving stealthily through the forest. You might also try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, such as orcs lying \\x0ein ambush, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\\n\\nPERFORMANCE\\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA)Your CHA (Performance) check determines how well you delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or other forms of entertainment.\\n\\nPERSUASION\\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA) en you a empt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask for a CHA (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use Persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etique e. Examples include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\\n\\nRELIGION\\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)Your INT (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\\n\\nSLEIGHT OF HAND\\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX) enever you a empt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting an item on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check.  e GM might also call for a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you li  a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person s pocket.\\n\\nSTEALTH\\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX)Make a DEX (Stealth) check when you a empt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\\n\\nSURVIVAL\\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS) e GM might ask you to make a WIS (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.33 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\\n\\nHIDING \\nThe GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you attempt to hide, make a DEX (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or stop hiding, that check result is contested by the Perception score of a creature who might discover you.You can’t attempt to hide from a creature that can sense you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.A creature with the invisible condition (see Appendix) can always attempt to hide and has advantage on DEX (Stealth) checks to do so. In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it typically senses you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a distracted creature, granting you advantage on an attack roll (see Unseen Attackers and Targets in the Combat section of this chapter).Perception Score. In a monster or NPC stat block, each creature has a Perception score. Whether a monster is actively searching for you or just going about their business, the GM compares your DEX (Stealth) check result to the creature’s Perception score to see whether they notice you.What Can You See? A big factor in determining whether you can find something is how well you can see. Visibility in an area could be lightly or heavily obscured (see Vision and Light in the Adventuring section of this chapter).'}\n{'role': 'user', 'content': 'the previous message is a bad scrape from a pdf please clean it up.'}\n{'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"CHAPTER 2: PLAYING THE GAME\\nRolling the Dice\\nMost of what happens during Black Flag game play can be handled through conversations between the player characters (PCs) and the Game Master (GM).

For more information about applying ability modifiers to checks, see the Which Ability Modifier? sidebar.\\n\\nPROFICIENCY BONUS\\nAll PCs have a proficiency bonus determined by their level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. Only add your PB to a die roll or DC once. Occasionally, you might double or halve your PB before you add it. If some circumstance suggests that your PB applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and double or halve it only once. If your PB doesn't apply to a roll, doubling doesn't change that.\\n\\nDETERMINING SUCCESS OR FAILURE\\nIn most cases, you measure your check result against a target number the GM sets for you, called a difficulty class (DC). If your check result is equal to or higher than the DC, your roll succeeds! If it's less than the DC, you fail.\\n\\nDETERMINING DC\\nMost of the time, the rules tell the GM what a DC should be. For example, a PC must get a check result of 19 or higher to successfully attack a creature with an AC 19 (AC is one example of a predetermined DC). Then the rules don't provide a DC, the GM gets to set an appropriate number. If you're the GM and you aren't sure, think about how hard you want a task to be. Then consult the Typical Difficulty Class table to assign a number. You can always set it at a number that isn't divisible by 5.\\n\\nTYPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASS\\nDifficulty DC\\nHigh Chance of Success 10 or less\\nModerate Chance of Success 15\\nLow Chance of Success 20\\nAlmost No Chance of Success 25 or higher\\n\\nLUCK\\nEvery PC has a special resource called Luck. Use Luck to influence the result of any ability check, attack roll, or save you make.\\n\\nSPENDING LUCK POINTS\\nSpend Luck points on a 1-for-1 bonus to add to any d20 roll you make. For example, if you have 4 Luck points and roll a 13 on the die, you could spend 2 Luck points and make your result a 15. You then have 2 Luck points to use later. You can't use Luck points to offset the effects of rolling a natural 1 or create the effects of a natural 20. No one is that lucky. Alternatively, immediately after you make an ability check, attack roll, or save, you can spend 3 Luck points to reroll a single d20 used for that roll.\\n\\nADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE\\nSometimes special circumstances allow you to roll a check with advantage or force you to roll a check with disadvantage. Rolling with advantage means you roll two d20s, then use the higher of the two numbers to calculate your check result. Rolling with disadvantage means you roll two d20s, then use the lower of the two numbers to calculate your check result. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel each other out, and you roll only one d20.\"}"

        "Combat\n\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, involving weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into rounds and turns, with each round representing about 6 seconds in the game world. Each participant in the battle takes a turn during a round. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter when all participants, including player characters (PCs) and monsters, roll initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round unless one side has defeated the other.\n\nSurprise\n\nSurprise can occur when one side gains the advantage over the other by stealthily approaching or catching them off guard. The Game Master (GM) determines who might be surprised. If neither side is being stealthy, they automatically notice each other. To determine surprise, the GM compares the DEX (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the Perception score of each creature on the opposing side. Anyone who doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter. Being surprised means you can't move or take an action on your first turn of combat and can't take a reaction until your turn ends. It's possible for some members of a group to be surprised while others are not.\n\nInitiative\n\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. At the start of combat, everyone involved rolls initiative to determine the order of combatants' turns. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time. The combatants are ranked in initiative order from highest to lowest DEX check result. Initiative order remains the same from round to round. If there is a tie, the GM and players decide the order among tied characters and creatures. Optionally, tied characters and monsters can each roll a d20 to determine the order.\n\nYour Turn\n\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move or take your action first. Your speed is noted on your character sheet and represents how far you can move. The most common actions you can take are described in the Actions in Combat section of the game rules. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action. You don't have to move or take an action if you can't decide what to do on your turn. In that case, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in the Actions in Combat section.\n\nBonus Actions\n\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities allow you to take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. For example, the Cunning Action feature allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a class feature, spell, or other special ability states that you can do something as a bonus action. You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which one to use if you have more than one available. You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the timing of the bonus action is specified. If something prevents you from taking an action, it also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\n\nReactions\n\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger, which can occur on your turn or someone else's. The most common type of reaction is the opportunity attack, which allows you to make an attack when a hostile creature moves out of your reach. When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If your reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.\n\nOther Activity on Your Turn\n\nYour turn can include minor actions or interactions that don't require your action or movement. You can communicate through brief talking and gestures at any time. You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free during either your movement or action. For example, you could open a door during your move or draw your weapon as part of your Attack action. If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magical items and special objects require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions. The GM may require you to use an action for activities that require special care or present unusual obstacles, such as opening a stuck door or turning a crank to lower a drawbridge.\n\nMovement and Position\n\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain an advantage. On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like, following the rules provided in the game. Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming, either combined with walking or as your entire move. However you move, deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\n\nBreaking Up Your Move\n\nYou can break up your movement on your turn by using some speed before and the remainder after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\n\nUsing Different Speeds\n\nIf you have more than one speed, such as a walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between them during your move. Each time you switch, subtract the distance you have already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet and a flying speed of 60 feet, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet. If you wanted to walk any farther, you would be done for your move, but you could still use your flying speed to move 30 feet more.\n\nDifficult Terrain\n\nCombat rarely takes place in open areas. The game recognizes various challenging terrains, such as rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs, that can impede movement. Each foot of movement in difficult terrain costs an extra foot. Difficult terrain can also include the space of another creature, which counts as difficult terrain for you.\n\nBeing Prone\n\nCombatants can find themselves lying on the ground either because they are knocked down or choose to throw themselves down. When prone, a creature has the prone condition. Dropping prone is free and doesn't require any movement, but standing up from prone costs movement equal to half your speed. Crawling is the most efficient way to move while prone, with each foot of movement while crawling costing an extra foot. Crawling through difficult terrain costs 3 feet of movement per foot crawled.\n\nMoving Around Other Creatures\n\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature's space, but moving through a hostile creature's space is only possible if the creature is two or more sizes larger or smaller than you. Another creature's space counts as difficult terrain for you, and you can't willingly end your move in its space. If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack from that creature.\n\nFlying Movement\n\nFlying creatures can enjoy many benefits, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls unless it has the ability to hover or is being held aloft by magic, such as the fly spell.\n\nCreature Size\n\nEach creature takes up a specific amount of space on the battlefield. Size categories determine the space a creature controls in combat. The size categories are Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, and Gargantuan. A creature's space is not an expression of its physical dimensions but rather the area it effectively controls.\n\nSpace\n\nA creature's space is the area, usually expressed in feet, that it controls in combat. It reflects both its physical dimensions and the area it needs to fight effectively. For example, a Medium creature controls a 5-foot square.\n\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space\n\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. For example, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that is only 5 feet wide. While squeezing, a creature must spend extra movement for each foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and DEX saves. Attacks against the creature have advantage while it's squeezing.\n\nActions in Combat\n\nThe most common action in combat is the Attack action, which allows you to make a melee or ranged attack. Depending on your class, you may also have access to additional actions. Spells and special abilities can provide other action options. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM determines whether it is possible and may require rolls to determine success or failure.\n\nAttack\n\nThe Attack action allows you to make one melee or ranged attack against a target within your attack's range. Different weapons and spells have specific rules for making an attack. When making an attack, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total meets or exceeds the target's AC, the attack hits. Certain features, such as the fighter's Multiattack, allow you to make multiple attacks with this action.\n\nCast a Spell\n\nSpellcasting characters and some monsters can take the Cast a Spell action in combat to cast a spell. You can only cast spells with a casting time of 1 action using this action. Spells with longer casting times require their own specific actions.\n\nDash\n\nThe Dash action grants you additional movement on your turn. You can move up to your speed, multiplied by two, when you take this action. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you can move up to 60 feet with a Dash action.\n\nDisengage\n\nThe Disengage action allows you to move without provoking opportunity attacks for the rest of your turn. This can be useful if you need to move away from an enemy without risking being attacked.\n\nDodge\n\nThe Dodge action allows you to focus on avoiding attacks until the start of your next turn. While dodging, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against you have disadvantage if you can see the attacker. This benefits is lost if you become incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.\n\nHelp\n\nThe Help action allows you to aid another creature in completing a task. This can involve providing advantage on ability checks or helping an ally to make their attack more effective. The specifics of how this action works depend on the situation and the GM's rulings.\n\nHide\n\nThe Hide action allows you to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide, attempting to avoid detection. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits described in the rules for unseen attackers and targets.\n\nReady\n\nThe Ready action allows you to prepare an action or move to be triggered by a specific circumstance on someone else's turn. For example, you could ready an attack to be made when a creature steps on a trap. This action requires you to use your reaction, and you must state the trigger and the action or move you will take when the trigger occurs.\n\nSearch\n\nThe Search action allows you to devote your attention to finding something. The GM may require ability checks, such as Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation), depending on the nature of your search.\n\nUse an Object\n\nThe Use an Object action allows you to interact with an object or feature in the environment. This action is usually required when interacting with more than one object on your turn or when interacting with a complex or tricky object that requires an ability check.\n\nMaking an Attack\n\nWhen making an attack, the attacker rolls an attack roll to determine if the attack hits the target. The attack roll is determined by rolling a d20 and adding relevant modifiers. If the attack roll equals or exceeds the target's AC, the attack hits. The specific modifiers and rules for the attack depend on the weapon or spell being used.\n\nAttack Rolls\n\nAn attack roll is determined by rolling a d20 and adding the relevant modifiers. The two most common modifiers are the ability modifier, which is either Strength or Dexterity depending on the weapon being used, and the proficiency bonus, which is added if the attacker is proficient with the weapon. The attack roll is compared to the target's AC to determine if the attack hits.\n\nModifiers to the Roll\n\nWhen making an attack roll, the attacker adds their ability modifier and proficiency bonus, if applicable, to the roll. The ability modifier used depends on the weapon being used. When using a spell that requires an attack roll, the ability modifier used is based on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.\n\nRolling 1 or 20\n\nIf the attack roll is a 20, it is a critical hit and the attack automatically hits, regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. The attacker then rolls all of the attack's damage dice twice and adds them together. If the attack roll is a 1, it is a critical failure and the attack automatically misses, regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.\n\nUnseen Attackers and Targets\n\nWhen attacking a target that you can't see, either because they are hiding or due to visibility conditions, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This disadvantage applies even if you can guess the target's location or if you can hear, but not see, the target. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, the attack automatically misses. On the other hand, if you are unseen by a target, you have advantage on attack rolls against them. If you are both unseen and unheard when making an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\n\nCover\n\nCover can provide protection during combat, making it more difficult for attackers to hit their targets. There are three degrees of cover: half cover, three-quarters cover, and total cover. Half cover grants a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saves, while three-quarters cover grants a +5 bonus. Total cover means that the target can't be targeted directly by an attack or spell.\n\nRanged Attacks\n\nRanged attacks involve using weapons or spells to strike at targets from a distance. Each ranged attack has a specific range, and attacks beyond the weapon's normal range have disadvantage. Certain weapons, such as crossbows and nets, have different rules for ranged attacks. Attacks made with ranged weapons in close combat have disadvantage unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\n\nMelee Attacks\n\nMelee attacks involve making physical strikes at targets within your reach. Different weapons and spells have specific rules for making melee attacks. Most creatures have a reach of 5 feet, allowing them to make melee attacks against targets within 5 feet of them. Some creatures, typically larger ones, have longer reach for melee attacks. Unarmed strikes, such as punches or kicks, also count as melee attacks. Attacks made with melee weapons add the relevant ability modifier to the damage.\n\nOpportunity Attacks\n\nAn opportunity attack is a reaction that can be triggered when a hostile creature moves out of your reach. When this happens, you can make a melee attack against the provoking creature. The opportunity attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. Taking the Disengage action can avoid provoking an opportunity attack.\n\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\n\nWhen you have a light melee weapon in each hand, you can use the Two-Weapon Fighting action to make a second attack with the weapon in your other hand as a bonus action. This action allows you to make an additional attack but does not add your ability modifier to the damage unless the modifier is negative. The weapon used for the bonus attack can be thrown if it has the thrown property.\n\nGrappling\n\nThe Grapple action allows you to make a special melee attack to grapple a creature. You can use one free hand to try and seize the target. This is a contested check, with the attacker making a Strength (Athletics) check and the target choosing between a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins, the target becomes grappled. The grappled condition specifies how it can end.\n\nShoving\n\nThe Shove action allows you to make a special melee attack to shove a creature. This can knock the target prone or push it away from you. Like grappling, shoving is a contested check, with the attacker making a Strength (Athletics) check against the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Success allows the attacker to knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away."

        "CHAPTER 2: PLAYING THE GAME\nRolling the Dice\nMost of what happens during Black Flag game play can be handled through conversations between the player characters (PCs) and the Game Master (GM). But whenever a PC attempts something remarkable, where there is the potential to fail, it is time to roll the dice. Your character's ability modifiers and proficiencies can increase your chances of success, along with other factors covered here. This section describes how dice rolls are used to determine success or failure. It outlines the stages of making a roll and how a roll may be affected by character capabilities or external circumstances.\n\nMAKING CHECKS\nMost dice rolls in the Black Flag Roleplaying game are checks. All checks involve rolling a 20-sided die called a d20. To make a check, roll a d20 to determine your starting number. Then add one of the ability modifiers on your character sheet. Finally, if you are proficient in something relevant to the roll, add your proficiency bonus (PB). The total of those numbers is your check result.\n\nCheck Formula\nCheck Result = d20 + Ability Modifier + PB (If you have a relevant proficiency)\n\nSTAGES OF A CHECK\n1. Player describes the task they want to accomplish.\n2. GM decides if a check is needed. If not, play continues. If a check is needed, proceed to the next step.\n3. GM declares what kind of check is needed, including which ability modifier it uses and what proficiencies are relevant.\n4. GM determines if the check is being made with advantage or disadvantage.\n5. Player rolls a d20 (or two d20s if they have advantage or disadvantage).\n6. Player adds their ability modifier and PB (if they have a relevant proficiency) to the number rolled to determine their check result.\n7. If desired, a PC spends Luck points to increase the check result.\n8. GM compares the check result to the check DC and declares whether the check succeeds or fails.\n\nABILITY MODIFIERS\nAll checks in the game are tied to one of the six ability modifiers: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Wisdom (WIS), Intelligence (INT), or Charisma (CHA). You add one of these six ability modifiers to every check. The rules typically dictate which modifier you must use for a particular check, but in cases where no ability is listed, the GM decides which one is relevant. For more information about applying ability modifiers to checks, see the Which Ability Modifier? sidebar.\n\nPROFICIENCY BONUS\nAll PCs have a proficiency bonus determined by their level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. Only add your PB to a die roll or DC once. Occasionally, you might double or halve your PB before you add it. If some circumstance suggests that your PB applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and double or halve it only once. If your PB doesn't apply to a roll, doubling doesn't change that.\n\nDETERMINING SUCCESS OR FAILURE\nIn most cases, you measure your check result against a target number the GM sets for you, called a difficulty class (DC). If your check result is equal to or higher than the DC, your roll succeeds! If it's less than the DC, you fail.\n\nDETERMINING DC\nMost of the time, the rules tell the GM what a DC should be. For example, a PC must get a check result of 19 or higher to successfully attack a creature with an AC 19 (AC is one example of a predetermined DC). Then the rules don't provide a DC, the GM gets to set an appropriate number. If you're the GM and you aren't sure, think about how hard you want a task to be. Then consult the Typical Difficulty Class table to assign a number. You can always set it at a number that isn't divisible by 5.\n\nTYPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASS\nDifficulty DC\nHigh Chance of Success 10 or less\nModerate Chance of Success 15\nLow Chance of Success 20\nAlmost No Chance of Success 25 or higher\n\nLUCK\nEvery PC has a special resource called Luck. Use Luck to influence the result of any ability check, attack roll, or save you make.\n\nSPENDING LUCK POINTS\nSpend Luck points on a 1-for-1 bonus to add to any d20 roll you make. For example, if you have 4 Luck points and roll a 13 on the die, you could spend 2 Luck points and make your result a 15. You then have 2 Luck points to use later. You can't use Luck points to offset the effects of rolling a natural 1 or create the effects of a natural 20. No one is that lucky. Alternatively, immediately after you make an ability check, attack roll, or save, you can spend 3 Luck points to reroll a single d20 used for that roll.\n\nADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE\nSometimes special circumstances allow you to roll a check with advantage or force you to roll a check with disadvantage. Rolling with advantage means you roll two d20s, then use the higher of the two numbers to calculate your check result. Rolling with disadvantage means you roll two d20s, then use the lower of the two numbers to calculate your check result. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel each other out, and you roll only one d20."

If you’re a Game Master (GM), look this over and familiarize yourself with the elements of a creature and its statistics before using a creature in your game. Description and Lore. Each creature entry includes an italicized description of it as well as lore describing the creature’s origins, typical motives, and similar. The italicized description at the top of each entry is written as if the player characters (PCs) just stumbled upon the creature and often can be read aloud to your players when their characters first encounter the creature. Elements of a Stat BlockThe information you need to use a creature in your game is organized into an easy-reference format called a stat block. This section describes the meaning of the terms in a stat block and the contents of each heading within the stat block. Note that each creature’s stat block has been written and organized with an eye toward making creatures faster and easier to use during your game, including displaying the precalculated results for ability checks, damage, ability scores, and other calculations.This chapter contains more than fifty monsters, including NPCs, described with lore, background, and game rules for use at the table.Optional Rule: DoomAt the start of each combat encounter, the Game Master (GM) gains a special resource called Doom based on the Challenge Rating (CR) of the encounter, as detailed in the Doom by Encounter Tier table. The GM can use Doom to influence the results of creature die rolls, turning the tide on the player characters (PC) or helping a creature last just one turn longer. The GM can spend Doom in the following ways:• Give a creature advantage on an attack roll• Give a PC disadvantage on a save• Once per encounter, refresh, recharge, or otherwise gain one additional use of a limited-use feature, such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon, a legendary creature’s Legendary Resistance, or a spell in a mage’s Spellcasting.Doom is optional and exists to give creatures some extra staying power against particularly powerful, crafty, or resourceful PCs. Keep in mind, Doom doesn’t have to be used in every combat encounter. As a GM, consider using Doom in an encounter if:• The combat encounter is likely the only combat encounter the PCs will face that day, and the PCs are well-rested.• You have multiple experienced players.• You have more than four players. • Your players’ characters have extra magic items, resources, optimized statistics, or similar aspects that make them tougher than average PCs.• If the encounter is particularly significant to the story, such as the fight against the leader of an antagonistic organization working against the PCs, the final fight of a major story arc, or a climactic fight against a powerful antagonist.97 Chaptier 5: Monsters\n\nNAME\nThis is what most people call this kind of creature. Some creatures have alternate names, regional names, or even specific titles, all of which are included in its lore.\n\nCHALLENGE RATING\nA creature’s challenge rating (CR) tells you how great a threat the creature is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a creature with a CR equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a creature with a CR of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.Creatures that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Creatures with a rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth 0 experience points (XP), while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.Some creatures present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These creatures have a CR of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.\n\nUSING CHALLENGE RATING\nCR ranges from 0 up to 30, with fractions of 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 between 0 and 1. In addition to helping determine the challenge compared to a party of PCs, CR can also help compare the challenge of one creature to another. For instance, a CR 2 creature is significantly less challenging than a CR 8 creature.Depending on the level of the PCs, creatures within a range of CRs tend to work better than those outside of this range. A CR that’s significantly lower than the PC party level doesn’t provide sufficient challenge. A CR that’s too high can be frustrating or even deadly to the PCs.The PC Level to Creature CR Comparison table shows the range of creature CRs that tend to match well with PCs of a given level. The lower number represents the lowest CR likely to challenge the PCs (often in massed numbers), while the higher number represents the highest creature CR the PCs can likely defeat in combat.\n\nPC LEVEL TO CREATURE CR COMPARISON\n\n\nPC LEVEL SUITABLE CREATURE CRS\n\n\n1 0–1/2\n\n\n2–4 1/8–6\n\n\n5–10 1–15\n\n\n11–16 3–21\n\n\n17–20 5–30\n\n\nEXPERIENCE POINTS BY CHALLENGE RATING\n\n\nCR XP CR XP CR XP\n0 0 or 10 9 5,000 21 33,000\n\n1/8 25 10 5,900 22 41,000\n\n\n1/4 50 11 7,200 23 50,000\n\n\n1/2 100 12 8,400 24 62,000\n\n\n1 200 13 10,000 25 75,000\n\n\n2 450 14 11,500 26 90,000\n\n\n3 700 15 13,000 27 105,000\n\n\n4 1,100 16 15,000 28 120,000\n\n\n5 1,800 17 18,000 29 135,000\n\n\n6 2,300 18 20,000 30 155,000\n\n\n7 2,900 19 22,000\n\n\n8 3,900 20 25,000\n\n\nEXPERIENCE POINTS\nThe number of experience points (XP) a creature is worth is based on its CR. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating a creature, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the creature in some other manner.\n\nSIZE\nThis is the relative size of the creature. A creature can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size occupies on a battle map or grid.\n\nSIZE CATEGORIES\n\n\nSIZE SPACE EXAMPLES\nTiny 2.5 x 2.5 ft. Imp, spriteSmall 5 x 5 ft. Giant rat, goblinMedium 5 x 5 ft. Orc, werewolfLarge 10 x 10 ft. Hippogriff, ogreHuge 15 x 15 ft. Fire giant, treantGargantuan 20 x 20 ft. or larger Kraken, purple worm\n\nTYPE\nA creature’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage to creatures of the dragon type, such as red dragons, dragon turtles, and wyverns. Here is an overview of each of the creature types. For a more detailed look at creature types, see Chapter 3.Aberrations are utterly alien beings. Many have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. Quintessential aberrations are creatures like aboleths, chuul, and gibbering mouthers.Black Flag Roleplaying 98Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense—frightening, abnormal creatures, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the result of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), others are the product of terrible curses (such as chimeras), and many are monstrous animals (such as griffons). Monstrosities defy categorization, and in some sense, serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit another type.Oozes are gelatinous predators without fixed forms. These mindless eating machines consume anything they can dissolve, living or otherwise. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or living creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.Plants are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as shriekers and mycolids also fall into this category.Undead are formerly living creatures brought to a state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic, dark rites, or curses. Undead creatures include mindless animated corpses like zombies, potent predators like vampires, and tormented souls that lack a body, like ghosts or specters.\n\nCATEGORIES\nSome creatures fall into categories that are a bit more specific than their creature types but not as game rule-related as tags. This categorization denotes the creatures are more closely related to each other than they are to other creatures of their same creature type, but there aren’t many, if any at all, game rules that reference or rely on that category. Categories are especially helpful when determining which creatures might be found together or working alongside each other. For example, bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins are all part of the goblin family, regularly work together, and often inhabit the same areas. As such, they are listed as “Goblin, Creature Name” in this book. \n\nTAGS\nCreatures may have various tags that further specify their creature type. If a creature has a tag, it appears as part of the creature’s stat block in parentheses after size and type. Tags indicate creatures that can be targeted by specific spells, magic items, and other features available to PCs. For example, the moonbeam spell has special effects against creatures with the Shapechanger tag. If a creature has a subtag, the creature is considered to be both its tag and its subtag, though only the subtag is listed in the creature’s stat block. For example, a werewolf is both a Lycanthrope and a Shapechanger—though only Beasts are living creatures of the natural world. Beasts include all varieties of wild animals, domesticated animals, and enormous creatures such as whales and dinosaurs.Celestials dwell in higher realms outside of measurable or material reality. Many are servants of deities, acting as messengers, heralds, or agents in the mortal realm. Most of them lean innately toward forces of good and order. All of them strive to oppose or destroy Fiends. Celestials include beings like angels, couatls, and pegasi.Constructs are made, not born. Often built of metal, stone, or wood, some are charged by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are given sentience and use independent thought. Golems, mechadrons, and clockwork creatures are iconic constructs.Dragons are large, reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons are highly intelligent, have innate magic, and grow in power as they increase in age, called age categories. The dragon creature type also includes creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less magical, and often less intelligent, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.Elementals are creatures born of raw elemental forces. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. Elemental creatures include beings like genies, azers, and invisible stalkers.Fey are magical creatures bound to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild or the Bright Lands, also called the Plane of Fey. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly in the Shadow Realm. Fey include dryads, sprites, and satyrs.Fiends dwell in lower realms outside of measurable or material reality. A few are servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. Most fiends lean innately toward forces of evil and chaos. All of them strive to oppose or destroy Celestials. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, and rakshasas.Giants are enormous, powerful beings that tower over lesser creatures. They are humanlike in shape, though some bear unique adaptations that allow them to thrive in the harsh environments they claim. True giants include stone giants, fire giants, and cloud giants, but this category also includes lesser giants, such as ogres and trolls.Humanoids are usually bipedal and often warm-blooded, including humans and a prodigious variety of other lineages. The most common Humanoids are the lineages available to player characters (PCs), including humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous are beings like goblinoids, gnolls, and lizardfolk.99 Chaptier 5: MonstersLycanthrope is listed in its stat block—and it is affected by spells, magic items, and other features that affect Shapechangers or Lycanthropes. The following are the most commonly used tags and their associated subtags:Animal. A creature that is not of the Beast type but shares enough characteristics with Beasts that it can be affected by spells, features, or other abilities that specifically target Beasts, such as the speak with animals spell. Golem. A specific type of Construct that is almost always humanoid in shape, is typically crafted wholly out of a specific material, and has some magical connection to its creator. This connection might be that the golem was made from the remains of the creator’s loved one, made with some of the creator’s blood, made from an object with great sentimental significance to the creator, or some other object or material personal to the creator.Outsider. A creature from another plane or realm not bound by laws of material or measurable reality. There are a wide range of Outsiders from a variety of planes and realms. Some of the most common Outsiders are Angels, Demons, and Devils, which are defined as the following:• Angel. A specific kind of Celestial Outsider bound in service to gods of good and order.• Demon. A specific type of Fiend Outsider bound to the forces of evil and chaos.• Devil. A specific type of Fiend Outsider bound in service to gods or fiendish lords of evil and order.Shapechanger. A creature capable of changing form, such as werewolves, doppelgangers, and vampires. This tag applies only to creatures with the natural ability to change their shape. It doesn’t apply to creatures that use magic—whether or not that magic is innate to the creature—to change their shape, such as gold dragons.• Lycanthrope. A specific kind of Humanoid Shapechanger that changes its shape due to an animalistic curse called lycanthropy, allowing the creature to transform to and from an Animal form, its Humanoid form, and a hybrid of the two. The curse is typically passed by an attack from another Lycanthrope or by the creature having a Lycanthrope parent. Though all Lycanthropes are Shapechangers, not all Shapechangers are Lycanthropes.\n\nARMOR CLASS (AC)\nArmor Class represents the creature’s defenses, often abbreviated to AC. The higher the number, the more difficult the creature is to hit in combat.The armor a creature uses (if any) is placed in parentheses after the AC value to help GMs alter the number if the creature’s armor is removed in some special circumstance.The AC included in each stat block has been calculated using the following formula. Keep in mind that AC is calculated before proficiency bonus (PB) is added to the Ability Modifiers as explained in the Ability Modifiers section, presented later in this chapter:AC = 10 + DEX modifier + Any Additional Bonuses (from equipment, natural armor, or special traits)\n\nHIT POINTS (HP)\nHit Points represent the health and vitality of the creature, often abbreviated to HP. The higher the number, the harder it is to kill or knock out the creature. Unlike PCs, creatures typically die or are destroyed when reduced to 0 HP.\n\nSPEED\nA creature’s speed defines how far it can move during a single round of combat. If the creature has multiple ways to move (such as swimming or flying), those are also listed in this section. All creatures have a walking speed, simply called speed. Creatures with no ground-based movement have a walking speed of 0 feet. Some creatures have one or more of the following additional ways to move. \n\nBURROW\nA creature with a burrowing speed can move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A creature can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a trait that allows it to do so.\n\nCLIMB\nA creature with a climbing speed can move on vertical surfaces with no check required. The creature doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.\n\nFLY\nA creature with a flying speed can move by flying. Some creatures can hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air. Such a creature stops hovering when it dies. If a creature can hover, the word “hover” appears in parenthesis after its fly speed.\n\nSWIM\nA creature with a swimming speed can move easily through liquid and doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.\n\nUSING DIFFERENT SPEEDS\nIf a creature has more than one speed, such as a walking speed and a flying speed, it can switch back and forth between its speeds during its move. Whenever the creature switches, subtract the distance the creature has already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther the creature can move. If the result is 0 or less, the creature can’t use the new speed during the current move.For example, if a creature has a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60, the creature could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.Black Flag Roleplaying 100\n\nPERCEPTION\nThe Perception Value shows how observant the creature is, regardless of whether it’s actively looking around. This Perception Value is calculated using a creature’s Wisdom \n\n(WIS).\nA PC attempting to hide from, sneak around, or stage a surprise attack against a creature must make a DEX (Stealth) check. If the result is equal to or higher than the creature’s Perception Value, the PC succeeds and remains undetected. If it is lower, the PC fails, and the creature detects the character.For instance, a goblin has a Perception Value of 9. A PC must roll a 9 or better on a DEX (Stealth) check to sneak past it.The Perception Value included in each stat block has been calculated using the following formula. Some creatures are naturally perceptive, which allows them to add their PB or even double their PB when calculating their Perception Value. In such cases, the Perception value in the stat block already includes that bonus.Perception Value = 10 + WIS modifier\n\nSTEALTH\nThe Stealth Value shows how readily a creature evades notice—either to sneak around or stage a surprise attack. Stealth is calculated using a creature’s Dexterity (DEX).A PC searching for unseen foes must make a WIS (Perception) check. If the result is equal to or higher than the creature’s Stealth score, the PC succeeds and detects signs of the creature. If it is lower, the PC fails, and the creature remains undetected.For instance, a goblin has a Stealth Value of 14. A PC must roll a 14 or better on a WIS (Perception) check to detect the goblin when it is trying to hide.The Stealth Value included in each stat block has been calculated using the following formula. Some creatures are naturally stealthy, which allows them to add their PB or even double their PB when calculating their Stealth Value. In such cases, the Stealth value in the stat block already includes that bonus.Stealth Value = 10 + DEX modifier\n\nIMMUNE, RESISTANT, AND VULNERABLE\nSome creatures are vulnerable, resistant, or immune to certain kinds of damage or conditions. Particular creatures are even vulnerable, resistant, or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks. A magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source.Multiple Protective Sources. Multiple instances of a creature being resistant or vulnerable to a type of damage count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage, such as a from its natural capabilities or the protection from energy spell, as well as resistance to nonmagical damage, such as from the gaseous form spell, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.Conditions and Damage. Each creature has only one line for each of the following categories. This means a creature resistant to cold damage and the grappled condition lists both cold and grappled in the Resistant line. In many cases, a creature being vulnerable, resistant, or immune to a condition is due to its creature type, which is noted as the associated trait’s name in the appropriate category line and detailed in the traits section of the stat block.\n\nVULNERABLE\nIf a creature is vulnerable to a type of damage and it takes damage of that type, the damage is doubled against the creature. For instance, a creature vulnerable to fire damage takes double damage from a fireball spell or flaming oil.A creature that is vulnerable to a condition has disadvantage on checks and saves made to avoid becoming affected by that condition or to end it.\n\nRESISTANT\nIf a creature is resistant to a type of damage and it takes damage of that type, the damage is halved (rounded down) against the creature. A creature that is resistant to a condition has advantage on checks and saves made to avoid becoming affected by that condition or to end it.\n\nIMMUNE\nIf a creature is immune to a type of damage, it doesn’t take damage of that type or lose hit points when subjected to that type of damage. If a spell, class feature, or other effect deals damage of a type to which a creature is immune and has an extra effect, such as causing the charmed or frightened condition, the creature doesn’t take that damage, but it might still be subjected to that extra effect. For example, a creature immune to bludgeoning damage would be immune to the bludgeoning damage of an otyugh’s Tentacle Slam, but it might still become stunned if it fails the CON save from Tentacle Slam.A creature that is immune to a condition automatically succeeds on checks and saves to avoid the condition and otherwise can’t be affected by that condition.\n\nSENSES\nCreatures primarily perceive the world by sight. This is called vision. Creatures usually have secondary senses of hearing, smell, and touch that also allow them to interact with the environment, but vision is considered the “standard” primary sense.If a creature has no unusual sensory capacity, this section 101 Chaptier 5: Monstersis marked with “—”. If a creature has a specialized sense that allows it to perceive in some way other than vision, it is noted in the senses line, followed by a radius in feet that defines the sense’s maximum range. Specialized senses that appear in a stat block:\n\nDARKVISION\nA creature with darkvision can see in nonmagical darkness. The creature can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light and can see in darkness as if it were dim light. A creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many nocturnal creatures and creatures that live underground have this special sense.\n\nKEENSENSE\nA creature with keensense can perceive its surroundings using a sense other than vision. Creatures without vision, such as morlocks and gelatinous cubes, typically have this sense, as do creatures with echolocation or an extraordinary sense of smell, such as bats and true dragons.If a creature has no other form of sensing, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its keensense defines the maximum range of its perception.\n\nTREMORSENSE\nA creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the source of vibrations if it and the source are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and purple worms, have this special sense.\n\nTRUESIGHT\nA creature with truesight can see clearly in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect and succeed on saves against visual illusions, and perceive the original form of a Shapechanger or creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane within range.\n\nLANGUAGES\nThe languages that a creature can speak are listed in alphabetical order. If a creature can understand a language but can’t speak it, this is noted on this line. A “—” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language. Most languages are specific to a particular heritage or culture; a few are based on faith, commerce, or traveler’s tongues. \n\nTELEPATHY\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature to mentally communicate with another creature within a specified range. A telepathic creature can start or end a telepathic conversation at will, without using an action, like talking. A telepathic creature doesn’t need to see a contacted creature to communicate, it just needs to be in range.A telepathic creature can communicate with a creature that doesn’t have telepathy. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the telepathic creature to communicate, but it must be able to understand at least one language. The contacted creature can receive and respond to telepathic messages, but it can’t start or end telepathic communication.Contact breaks if two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic creature contacts a different creature. While a telepathic creature is incapacitated, it can’t start telepathy, and any contact ends.A creature in an antimagic field or in any location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.\n\nABILITY MODIFIERS\nEvery creature has six ability modifiers: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA). These modifiers are used to determine pre-calculated elements of a stat block (like attack and damage). More importantly, the GM uses them whenever a creature must make:• A save. The GM rolls a d20 and adds the relevant ability modifier.• An ability check. The GM rolls a d20 and adds whichever ability modifier is most relevant.If a creature is particularly good at checks and saves involving a certain ability, the creature’s proficiency bonus (PB) has already been added into the ability modifiers presented in the stat block. You don’t need to add PB to any number in a stat block—it’s already calculated for you.\n\nTRAITS\nTraits are a creature’s special characteristics that are likely to be relevant in combat. In a stat block, they appear after a creature’s ability modifiers but before any actions. \n\nACTIONS\nWhen a creature takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Combat rules (see Chapter 2).\n\nMELEE AND RANGED ATTACKS\nThe most common actions that a creature takes in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a physical Black Flag Roleplaying 102item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.Creature vs. Target.The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target. The difference is that a “target” can be a creature, object, or structure. This designator on an attack reflects the creature’s natural inclination, but it doesn’t mean a tyrannosaurus rex can’t or won’t bite at a door to get to a creature it can smell on the other side. This designator helps reflect that a creature like a tyrannosaurus rex isn’t likely to strategically attack pillars of a building to make the building collapse on its prey or to otherwise attack an object or structure in a way that isn’t directly related to reaching its prey.Hit. Any damage dealt and other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit:” notation. In the Alpha Release, you might notice the math doesn’t match up perfectly. We’re trying some things to bring the power curve up a bit. Don’t sweat the arithmetic for now. But do note how the damage values work for your table.\n\nMULTIATTACK\nA creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\n\nAMMUNITION\nA creature carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. A creature generally has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\n\nSPELLCASTING\nA creature with the Spellcasting action is capable of casting spells through innate magical talent. Unless noted otherwise, a spell of 1st ring or higher is always cast at its lowest possible ring and can’t be cast at a higher ring. If a creature has a cantrip where its spellcaster level matters and no level is given, use the creature’s challenge rating.A creature doesn’t adhere to the tenets, restrictions, or requirements of specific spellcasting classes, circles of magic, or similar spellcasting structures found among player characters, as a creature’s spellcasting is unique to the creature. A creature’s spells can’t be swapped out with other spells.\n\nSPELL ATTACKS AND SAVE DCS\nThe Spellcasting action always lists the creature’s spellcasting ability and the spell save DC for its spells. When a spell requires a spell attack roll, use the creature’s spellcasting ability modifier + the creature’s proficiency bonus to determine the creature’s total spell attack bonus.\n\nSPELL COMPONENTS\nThe Spellcasting action always notes if the creature doesn’t need to use a particular type of spell component, such as material components. If no exception is listed in the creature’s Spellcasting action, the creature must provide all necessary components to cast the spell. For the purposes of casting a spell, a creature needs free use of at least one limb to produce gestures for somatic components rather than specifically free use of one hand. \n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nIf a creature can do something special with its bonus action, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special bonus action, this section is absent.\n\nREACTIONS\nIf a creature can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\n\nLIMITED USAGE\nSome traits or actions have restrictions on the number of times they can be used. Common examples:X/Day. This means a special ability can be used a limited number of times in a day, where “X” is a number (often 1 or 3). The creature must finish a long rest to regain expended uses.For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and then the creature must finish a long rest to use it again.Recharge X–Y. This means a creature can use a special ability once. Afterward, the ability has a random chance of recharging during each round of combat. “X” and “Y” are values on a d6 (often 5 and 6). At the start of each of the creature’s turns, roll a d6. If the result is in the range of numbers in the recharge notation, the creature regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the creature finishes a short or long rest.For example, “Recharge 5–6” means a creature can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the creature’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This means that a creature can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.Conditional. This covers a lot of territory where an ability can be used only after a certain condition is met. This information always appears in parenthesis. For example, “Vicious Bound (44 HP or Fewer)” means a creature can’t use the Vicious Bound action unless it has 44 hit points (HP) or fewer remaining.\n\nEQUIPMENT\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than a creature’s armor or weapons. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a Humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.A GM can equip creatures with additional gear and 103 Chaptier 5: Monsterstrinkets as desired. The GM decides how much of a creature’s equipment is recoverable after it is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a creature is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.If a spellcasting creature needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has what it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.\n\nLEGENDARY CREATURES\nA legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\n\nLEGENDARY ACTIONS\nA legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions—called legendary actions—outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It doesn’t have to use them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nLAIRS\nA legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.\n\nLAIR ACTIONS\nIf a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nREGIONAL EFFECTS\nThe mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.\n\nMONSTERS A TO Z\nThis section contains creature entries in alphabetical order with Animals and NPCs listed in separate sections at the end.Animated ObjectsThe emptiness within the suit of plate mail’s visor demonstrates that no creature controls the armor from inside it. An iron sword floats in midair at rest—then suddenly swings and flourishes as though wielded by a trained swordfighter.Animated objects are nonmagical objects given life by a spellcaster. Though little more than their mundane counterparts, animated objects can be given basic instructions to follow indefinitely or until given new instructions by their creators. The most common animated objects are decorative or seemingly innocuous armor and weapons instructed to protect their creators’ homes, laboratories, treasuries, or other locations important to their creators.Animated Armor. Crafted to look like field armor with dents and scratches showing signs of its use in battle, or ornately decorated for those who want something more aesthetically pleasing, animated armor moves as quickly as those who might wear it. It pummels foes with its gauntlets but can kick or otherwise ram opponents in the absence of its gauntlets.Flying Sword. Often paired with animated armor, a flying sword appears equally as battle-worn or ornate as the accompanying armor. The sword may also sit alone, innocuous among a rack of weapons, ready to fly out at intruders. Though more maneuverable than most animated objects, its fragility makes it easier to destroy.Animated Armor CR 1Medium Construct Armor Class 18 (natural armor)Hit Points 34Speed 25 ft.Perception 8 Stealth 10Vulnerable acidResistant slashingImmune Construct ResilienceSenses keensense 60 ft.

Within its translucent form, strings of undulating comb-like structures scintillate with an eerie crimson glow. Crimson jellies drift upon the currents of the endless darkness in deep waters or the underworld. These aggressive carnivores feed upon whatever creatures they come across. Their translucent forms are nearly invisible, and they move so rapidly, few creatures realize their presence until a jelly begins feasting on them.Swarming. Crimson jellies reproduce asexually and with extreme speed. Almost immediately after feeding, the creatures break away from prey and divide. Within moments of encountering a single jelly, the unwary can be overwhelmed by a growing mob of ravenous jellies.Crimson Jelly CR 1/2Tiny OozeArmor Class 12Hit Points 20Speed 0 ft., fly 60 ft.

The crimson jelly doesn’t require sleep.Ooze Resilience. The crimson jelly is resistant to the grappled and restrained conditions, and it is immune to exhaustion and to the blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, and prone conditions.105 Chaptier 5: MonstersTainted Attacks. A creature that is reduced to 0 HP by a crimson jelly must succeed on a DC 9 CHA save or suffer one level of exhaustion. While a creature suffers from this exhaustion, it loses most of its memories aside from basic information about itself, such as its name and its capabilities, and it is wracked with nightmarish visions that include a crimson rune.Transparent. While in an area of dim or bright light, the crimson jelly is invisible. While in darkness, creatures without darkvision can see the jelly’s faint crimson glow.\n\nACTIONS\nFeeding Paddles. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The crimson jelly gains temporary HP equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and it attaches to the target. If the jelly had advantage on this attack, it attaches to the target’s face, leaving the target unable to breathe or speak while the jelly is attached. While attached, the crimson jelly can use only the Feeding Paddles action, and it moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the jelly’s movement. The Crimson jelly can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the jelly by succeeding on a DC 12 STR check.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nReproduce (Requires Temporary HP). While the crimson jelly has 1 or more temporary HP, it can split part of itself off into a new crimson jelly with HP equal to the original crimson jelly’s temporary HP. The original crimson jelly then loses any temporary HP it has. The new crimson jelly otherwise has all the same statistics as its parent, except the new jelly can’t gain temporary HP from Feeding Paddles attacks until it finishes a long rest.Demon, HuskThe formless pile of desiccated hide and broken scales slowly twists and writhes across the ground like a sheet of canvas in the wind. As it draws closer, a guttural syllabic echo drones in a psychic reverberation.Life on abyssal planes isn’t easy, even for the demons native to it. Without regular trips to other planes, some lesser demons eventually wear away as the reality-bending chaos consumes them. What remains is known as a husk demon.Expunged. Drained by the chaos and endless fury, little remains of what these demons once were, save for rage and hunger. Husk demons seek to consume the souls of sentient creatures from other planes, a whisper of their demonic form promising relief in the pits of the Abyss, if only they can consume enough souls. These demons slurp at the bodies and souls of creatures, steadily leeching the vitality and thirst for life from victims. After a kill, many husk demons burn and mutilate their victim with a mark of their patron demon. Whether the husk demon recalls the meaning of the mark remains uncertain.Tied to the Past. Husk demons inhabit the ruins of demonic strongholds, ancient demonic prisons, or temples on the Material Plane dedicated to dead gods or infernal exiles. Such sites often contain lost relics and artifacts to which the demons shared a distant connection in life. Experienced scavengers and looters tend to avoid areas said to be inhabited by husk demons, believing the demons to be long-dead guardians pressed into service by the powerful objects themselves. Unfortunate explorers or travelers seeking shelter from the weather may accidentally wander into such places on the Material Plane and find themselves surrounded by these starving fiends.Husk Demon CR 4 Medium Fiend (Demon)Armor Class 15Hit Points 82Speed 40 ft., fly 25 ft.Perception 13 Stealth 15 Resistant Demonic ResilienceImmune necrotic | exhaustion, prone | Demonic ResilienceSenses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Abyssal, telepathy 60 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+1 +5 +3 −2 −1 −3\nAmorphous.

The husk demon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The husk demon makes two Life Drain attacks.Life Drain. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage, and the husk demon regain HP equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. The target must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or its HP maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creatures finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its HP maximum to 0.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nSoul Feed. The husk demon feasts on the light in the soul of up to two creatures it can see within 20 feet of it, causing one of the following effects. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 CHA save or suffer the chosen effect. A creature that fails the save against Soul Feed two rounds in a row suffers one level of exhaustion.Black Flag Roleplaying 106• Happiness Feast. The husk demon feasts on the target’s happiness, causing the target to become crestfallen. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.• Hope Feast. The husk demon feasts on the target’s hope, causing the target to become despondent. The target has disadvantage on saves until the end of its next turn.• Motivation Feast. The husk demon feasts on the target’s motivation, causing the target to lose its ambitions and become apathetic. The target’s speed is halved until the end of its next turn. Demon, QuasitThis miniature fiend has horns jutting from its head, and its oversized bat ears almost rival the horns in length. It gazes with expressionless, black eyes.Quasits take to mortal worlds to escape bullying from most other demons and to spread Abyssal destruction there by making themselves available as familiars to spellcasters. While serving as familiars, quasits goad their masters into vile acts. These acts often start small and simple, slowly escalating until the master has been fully corrupted by the quasit’s influence. Cowardly Shapechangers. Quasits rarely show their true forms, preferring instead to assume a shape suited for its current environment. The cowardly creatures also rely on their invisibility to escape destruction.Quasit CR 1Tiny Fiend (Demon)Armor Class 13 Hit Points 35 Speed 40 ft.Perception 10 Stealth 15Resistant Demonic ResilienceImmune Demonic ResilienceSenses darkvision 120 ft.Languages Abyssal, Common\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n−3 +5 +0 −2 +0 +0\nDemonic Resilience.

Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or take 5 (2d4) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.Slam (Beast Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (based on the type of damage dealt by the Beast form’s primary attack, such as Bite).Invisibility (True Form Only). The quasit magically turns invisible until it attacks, uses Scare, or uses Change Shape, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the quasit wears or carries is invisible with it.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nChange Shape. The quasit magically transforms into a Medium or smaller Beast that has a CR no higher than its own or back into its true form, which is a Fiend. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.Scare (1/Day; True Form Only). One creature of the quasit’s choice within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.Dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus RexThough this bipedal saurian has relatively stubby forelimbs, its crushing jaw and long sweeping tail mark it as a formidable predator.One of the most aggressive and territorial dinosaurs, tyrannosaurs attack with confidence. They grab their prey, shaking it and crushing it with their powerful jaws while walloping other creatures with their tails. The dinosaurs attack their opponents until they or their opponents are dead. Humanoids suffering from tyrannosaurus predation keep tyrannosaur skulls as trophies when they manage to defeat the dinosaurs. A typical tyrannosaurus rex stands 15 feet tall, measures 35 feet from snout to tail, and weighs 7 tons.Tyrannosaurus Rex CR 8Huge BeastArmor Class 13 (natural armor)Hit Points 184Speed 50 ft.Perception 14 Stealth 10Senses —Languages —\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+8 +0 +4 −4 +1 −1\n107 Chaptier 5: Monsters\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The velociraptor makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack.Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the velociraptor can’t Bite another target.Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.Maul. The velociraptor uses its claws to rip into one creature it is grappling. The target must make a DC 12 STR save, taking 10 (4d4) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.Dragon, BlackThis dragon has glossy black scales pitted gray and white with acid stains. Its crocodilian maw continually dribbles acid that hisses when it strikes something.Black dragons are consummate bullies and aggressively defend their lairs against lesser creatures, often making examples of those they see as a threat. This also applies to their mates and their own young, which flee the most powerful specimen when they can. If a dragon learns about a settlement encroaching on its swampy domain, it first sends its allies to drive the interlopers away, and then it makes a personal visit to destroy any remaining resistance.Cowardly. As bullies, black dragons quail in the face of superior beings, often in the form of larger black dragons resettling from other swampy lairs or their own young who have amassed enough wealth, power, and age to challenge their sire. When necessary, black dragons engage in ambushes, short raids, and night attacks to undermine stronger foes.Gem Hoarders. Conditions force black dragons to carefully select their treasures. Metal corrodes from exposure to the dragons’ acid and the damp air. Paper soaks through and disintegrates. Wood bloats and warps. Enchanted items last longer, but they too ultimately succumb to corrosion. However, gems persist in the unfavorable environment, so black dragons collect as many as possible. Each dragon has a favorite type of gem they covet, ranging from sapphires and rubies through less common stones like tourmalines and garnets. While the dragons don’t have deep caverns for their hoards, the shallow waters of the swamps make it relatively simple to dredge for stored gems.Local Despots. Compared to most chromatic dragons, black dragons content themselves with their own domain and rarely see the need to fly somewhere distant, devastate an area, and plunder from the fallen. They are satisfied with waylaying hapless travelers in their territory and retrieving treasure from those claimed by the swamp without their intervention.\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The tyrannosaurus makes one Bite attack and one Tail attack. It can’t make both attacks against the same target.Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tyrannosaurus can’t Bite another target.Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nRending Shake. While grappling a creature, the tyrannosaurus shakes its head, tearing at the creature. The grappled creature must succeed on a DC 16 STR save or take 6 (1d12) slashing damage and be thrown up to 20 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If the thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 DEX save or take the same damage and be knocked prone.Dinosaur, VelociraptorA small, wispy-feathered creature with a sweeping tail, vicious needle-like teeth, and hooked claws on its powerful back legs tilts its head from side to side before it darts forward.An effective pack hunter, the velociraptor rarely travels alone. These dinosaurs spread out from one another and surround their prey, attacking ferociously from blind spots, ripping and tearing their targets with savage claws on their hind legs. Hard to train and forever plagued by instincts to kill, only the most foolish and determined humanoids attempt to tame velociraptors. Career caretakers display missing fingers and ghoulish scars as badges of honor.Velociraptor CR 1/2 Small BeastArmor Class 13 (natural armor)Hit Points 25Speed 30 ft.Perception 13 Stealth 14Senses —Languages —\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n−2 +4 +1 −3 +1 −2\nPack Tactics.

Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 49 (11d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.Dragon, RedThe mighty red dragons are one of the most feared varieties of dragons. Powerful, intelligent, and cunning, their attacks rend armor, and their flaming breath devastates anyone foolish enough to stand against them. Older red dragons develop additional attacks and even the ability to cast spells.Avaricious and Territorial. Most dragons maintain hoards of gold, treasure, and magical items, but the greed of the red dragons is as legendary as their fire. They amass vast troves of wealth, preferring quantity over quality, and display trophies and skulls of slain foes prominently. Red dragons prefer to lair in volcanic caverns within mountains or subterranean areas of extreme heat. They surround their hoard chambers with twisting tunnels full of traps and guardians provided by the lesser creatures forced to serve them. Red dragons brook no incursions into their territory, which can stretch for miles around their lairs, and react to any perceived trespass with fury and fire.Dominating Pride. Red dragons truly believe they are the mightiest of all dragons and superior to all other creatures. They are quick to boast of their own greatness and happy to demonstrate their supremacy by fang or fire. This pride makes them tyrannical, and many red dragons delight in forcing tribute or service from lesser creatures.Incendiary Rage. The magical core of fire at the heart of every red dragon both generates their incinerating breath and makes them quick to anger. They take offense at even slight provocation, flying into devastating rages that last until their fury is vented.\n\nA RED DRAGON’S LAIR\nA red dragon favors high mountains, claiming snowy peaks, fuming volcanoes, or sprawling ancient ruins. A red dragon’s immense strength, agile flight, and comfort in blistering temperatures make its lair difficult to traverse for most other creatures. From its skyward vantage point, a red dragon peers down at what it considers to be lesser kin. In the most extreme lairs, precariously maintained above the churning interior of active volcanoes, red dragons 109 Chaptier 5: Monstersretain azers, fire elementals, fire giants, and devils or demons to serve their whims. Sprawling dwarven tunnels, forgotten giant foundries, or lakes of boiling stone make the perfect respite for a red dragon’s clutch or nest.\n\nLAIR ACTIONS\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a red dragon can take one of the following lair actions. The dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:• Collapse. The ceiling on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it collapses, covering a 20-foot square area on the ground directly below that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or be knocked prone and buried under the rubble. A buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 15 STR check while within reach of the buried creature.• Swirling Ash. Searing ash blasts a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 15 CON save. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. The ash ignites flammable objects within 30 feet of that point that aren’t being worn or carried.• Conflagrate. One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it becomes tethered to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The target must succeed on a DC 15 CHA save or be burned for 1 minute. While burned, the target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The effect ends early if the target takes cold damage, is submerged in water, or the burn is removed with a greater restoration spell or similar magic.\n\nREGIONAL EFFECTS\nThe region containing a red dragon’s lair is suffused with fiery chaos, which creates one or more of the following effects.• Acid Rain. Within 10 miles of the red dragon’s lair, precipitation is oily and stinks of sulfur. Snow in the area may be gray or black as it falls, appearing like ash, though its temperature is unchanged.• Incited Rage. Creatures within 3 miles of the red dragon’s lair are quick to anger and slow to forgive. Such creatures have disadvantage on CHA checks, except CHA (Intimidation), and Beasts in the area that aren’t domesticated are more aggressive than normal.• Unnatural Heat. Within 1 mile of the red dragon’s lair, temperatures are unnaturally high. Vegetation in the area withers and eventually crumbles to dust. Creatures in the area require twice as much water as normal each day to survive, and each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 10 CON save every hour it remains in the area or suffer one level of exhaustion. Creatures that are resistant or immune to fire damage are unaffected by this regional effect.Red Dragon Wyrmling CR 4 Medium Dragon Armor Class 17 (natural armor)Hit Points 85Speed 30 ft., climb 30 ft., fly 60 ft.Perception 14 Stealth 12Immune fireSenses darkvision 60 ft., keensense 10 ft.

Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.Detect. The dragon automatically detects every creature and trap within 30 feet of it, pinpointing the current location of each.Tail Attack. The dragon makes a Tail attack.Elemental Roar (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon roars at up to two creatures of its choice within 120 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 CHA save or be vulnerable to fire damage until the end of its next turn. A target resistant to fire damage isn’t resistant to it for the duration. A target immune to fire damage is still immune to it, even if the target fails the save.Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 DEX save or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.Elemental, FireThis mobile flame casts light in varying hues of yellow and orange, setting flammable objects alight as it touches them.Fire elementals are the most inherently destructive of the quartet of elementals, burning and igniting everything they touch. Fortunately, they react to water like ordinary fire, but as intelligent creatures, they back away from the immediate threat of extinguishment only to then quickly maneuver around it to strike at opponents, especially those using water as a weapon.

The fire elemental doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.Elemental Resilience. The fire elemental is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, it is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the grappled, paralyzed, 111 Chaptier 5: Monsterspetrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious conditions.Fire Form. The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the burning creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.Illumination. The elemental sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.Water Susceptibility. For every 5 feet the elemental moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The elemental makes two Fiery Touch or Spit Fire attacks.Fiery Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) fire damage.

Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) fire damage.Gelatinous CubeA floating skeleton surrounded by a wreath of coins moves towards you. As it approaches your light, you realize it is suspended within a quivering, transparent cube of goo.With cubical forms adapted to dungeon corridors, gelatinous cubes can feed on anything found on the floors, walls, or even ceilings. They can digest softer organic materials, such as cloth, flesh, leather, and even wood, over time. Harder materials, such as bone and metals, are eventually passed out of the cube. Gelatinous cubes are practically invisible unless they have fed recently and still carry non-digestible items within them.Gelatinous Cube CR 2 Large OozeArmor Class 6Hit Points 75Speed 15 ft.Perception 8 Stealth 7 Vulnerable coldResistant Ooze ResilienceImmune acid, piercing | Ooze ResilienceSenses keensense 60 ft.

Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube’s Engulf and has disadvantage on the save. Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 STR check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.Ooze Nature. The cube doesn’t require sleep.Ooze Resilience.

When the cube enters a creature’s space, the creature must make a DC 13 DEX save. On a success, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed save.On a failed save, the cube enters the creature’s space, the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage, and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 13 STR check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.\n\nREACTIONS\nSkewer Prey. When the gelatinous cube is subjected to piercing damage, it can move a random creature engulfed by it to intercept the attack. The creature takes the piercing damage as if it were the target.GhoulThis gaunt, gray humanoid wears rags and smells strongly of rotting flesh. It flicks a long tongue out of its mouth, sensing for its next warm meal.Ghouls amass in nightmarish packs to scour the world for the flesh of the dead. Though capable hunters, most ghoul packs raid cemeteries and ancient crypts to feast on Black Flag Roleplaying 112putrefied flesh. Forever starving for their next meal, ghouls never decay nor age and may prowl the long-forgotten mausoleums of dead civilizations for thousands of years, searching for their next morsel of flesh.Abyssal Creator. A demon lord with dominion over undead laid waste to a mortal army and saw fit to experiment on the abundance of corpses. Thus were made the first ghouls. The demon lord crafted these ghouls to be undead shock troops smart enough to follow orders but not enough to question them.Bestial Nature. Contributing to their mental diminishment, ghouls have a never-ending desire to eat flesh. They carry none of their concerns from their former lives, so their clothes are reduced to rags. The animalistic ghouls hunt in packs, sniffing the air for prey and running on their forelimbs and legs when chasing down their victims. They also proudly embrace the nauseating stench they emanate after they consume and revel in their kills.Ghoul CR 1 Medium Undead Armor Class 12Hit Points 32Speed 30 ft., climb 30 ft.Perception 12 Stealth 14 Immune charmed | Undead ResilienceSenses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Common\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+1 +2 +0 −2 +2 −2\nGhoul Hunger. A disease spread by ghouls, ghoul hungerinstills a despicable hunger for Humanoid flesh in the creature suffering it. Until the disease is cured, the infected creature is poisoned. This effect can be suppressed for 1 hour if the infected creature consumes any amount of Humanoid flesh. Every 12 hours that elapse, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or its HP maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6). The creature has disadvantage on this save if it consumed any amount of Humanoid flesh while diseased. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The creature dies if this effect reduces its HP maximum to 0. If the infected creature fails two of these saves or dies while infected, it becomes a ghoul, or a ghast if its PB is +4 or higher, in a flesh-rending transformation. Only a wish spell or similarly powerful magic can reverse the transformation. A creature that succeeds on two saves recovers from the disease.Hungry Dead Nature. The ghoul doesn’t require air or sleep. In addition, it must consume at least 2 pounds of raw meat every 24 hours, or it loses its immunity to exhaustion and risks starvation until it does so. While it has any levels of exhaustion from starvation, the ghoul can’t remove levels of exhaustion until it consumes at least 4 pounds of raw meat. Spider Climb. The ghoul can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.Undead Resilience. The ghoul is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The ghoul makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack. If both attacks hit a Humanoid target, the target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or contract Ghoul Hunger (see the Ghoul Hunger trait). Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage.Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf, Construct, or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.Goblin, BugbearA hirsute, brown-furred humanoid with dark eyes and elongated ears wields a massive, heavily spiked club.Named for their unique appearance, bugbears embraced the terror-inducing term. The consummate carnivores enjoy the crunch of bones beneath their bloody clubs.Bullies.While bugbears prefer to hunt and battle alone, they sometimes find themselves in leadership positions over smaller goblins. Their command is marked by bouts of terror, where they randomly inflict pain or humiliation on their subordinates. They don’t expect pushback from lesser goblins, but they back down from the rare, coordinated response. This attitude persists when bugbears fight other creatures. If assured of an easy win, they brutalize and taunt their foes. However, they flee when their opponents demonstrate superiority on the battlefield, unless an even more powerful leader threatens their lives.Sneaky Combatants. Owing to their cowardice, bugbears try to attack with the element of surprise and are deadly against surprised enemies. They wait for cover of darkness or choose locations where they can hide. If the conditions aren’t right, they coerce their subordinates to create a distraction for them.Bugbear CR 1 Medium Humanoid Armor Class 14 (hide armor)Hit Points 40Speed 30 ft.Perception 10 Stealth 16Senses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Common, Goblin113 Chaptier 5: Monsters\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+5 +2 +1 −1 +0 −1\nBrutal.

Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage in melee or 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage at range.\n\nREACTIONS\nStubborn Attacker (Recharge 5–6). When the champion misses with an attack, it can change that miss to a hit.GoblinStepping out of the shadows, this small yellowish-green humanoid has long, pointed ears and peculiar nose slits. It grins slyly as a dozen more step into view behind it.Though often considered the lowest of sneaks and thieves, goblins largely ignore what others think of them, stubbornly prospering in areas disregarded by civilization and completing tasks that others disdain. Fortunately, a goblin can find joy almost anywhere.Cunning Over Strength. Goblin leaders are chosen for their intelligence and deviousness rather than strength at arms. Similarly, goblins value numbers over an individual’s strength, relying on each other to overwhelm powerful foes.Natural Spies. Many goblins parley their natural stealth into careers. In urban environments, they excel in spycraft, information gathering, and thievery. In the wilderness, goblins are skillful scouts, trappers, and bandits.Delight in Thievery. Goblin culture considers stealing a delightful challenge. A goblin who can’t guard a possession doesn’t deserve it. Every goblin appreciates a good robbery, even if they are the victim. However, this peculiarity often leads to friction between goblins and other peoples.Goblin CR 1/4Small Humanoid Armor Class 15 (leather armor, shield)Hit Points 12Speed 30 ft.Perception 9 Stealth 14 Senses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Common, Goblin\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n−1 +4 +0 +0 −1 −1\n\n\nACTIONS\nScimitar.

Each friendly goblin within 30 feet of the goblin can use its reaction to join the gang up and move up to half its speed toward the same target. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. If the initiating goblin is within 5 feet of the target, the target must make a DC 12 DEX save, taking 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For each goblin after the first that participated in the gang up and that is within 10 feet of the target, the damage increases by 1 as arrows, knives, sharp pocket scraps, Black Flag Roleplaying 114and similar “weapons” fly at the target from all angles. Afterwards, each goblin after the first that participated in the gang up can’t use Gang Up until it finishes a short or long rest.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nNimble Escape.

When a creature the goblin captain can see targets it with an attack, the captain can sidestep behind an ally within 5 feet of it, moving to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the ally. The chosen ally becomes the target of the attack instead.Goblin, HobgoblinThe military bearing of this humanoid is evident in its stance and in its readied weapon. The warrior’s yellow eyes seem to watch everything.Hobgoblins stand about as tall as a human, though they are more powerfully built. As a society, most hobgoblin enclaves are highly organized military communities, called cohorts, where members are ranked according to their skills and accomplishments.Rule Bound. The militant hobgoblins live their lives according to the Decrees, a complicated set of rules, laws, and customs. Tenets of the Decrees are so ingrained that even hobgoblins who leave the community to become adventurers continue to model their reactions and decisions on its lessons.The Goblin Oath. All hobgoblins are sworn to serve their cohorts from birth, raised to honor the Decrees and their superiors in equal measure. The cohort combines military virtues with family loyalty to create a potent whole. To swear by the cohort is the most binding promise a hobgoblin can give.Hobgoblin CR 1/2Medium Humanoid Armor Class 18 (chain mail, shield)Hit Points 18Speed 30 ft.Perception 10 Stealth 8 (13 without heavy armor)Senses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Common, Goblin\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+1 +1 +1 +0 +0 −1\n\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack.

The hobgoblin commander employs one of the following tactics:• Emboldening Shout. One friendly creature within 30 feet of the hobgoblin commander that it can see gains 7 (2d6) temporary HP until the start of the commander’s next turn.• Pressing Advance. The commander moves up to half its speed and commands one friendly creature it can see within 30 feet of it to also move. The target can use its reaction to move up to half its speed in the direction of the commander’s choosing. This movement for both creatures is unaffected by difficult terrain and doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.GrimlockUttering a repetitive clicking sound, a rugged, human-like creature shuffles forward, cocking its head to one side as if listening intently. It has gray skin, stringy hair, and large, sightless red eyes.Grimlocks descend from the human population of a vast empire long ago lost to the underground in some forgotten calamity. Over generations, they adapted to the world below ground, gradually losing their sight and evolving new senses.Blind Stewards. Xenophobic hunter-gatherers, grimlocks retain some slight vestige of their ancestors’ mighty empire in the form of complicated techno\u0002arcane devices. Grimlock shamans use complicated oral traditions to pass down knowledge of how to maintain these machines, though few grimlocks know how to construct them. This doesn’t stop grimlocks from pocketing baubles cast off from these devices, and many grimlocks have found the baubles to be effective at repelling or disorienting intruders.Echosense. Grimlocks speak and understand the language of the subterranean world, though they prefer to speak their own dialect of Dwarvish. The clicking sounds that form most of their words also serve as a form of echolocation.Sensitive Hearing. Relying on hearing and scent, grimlocks thrive in dark environments. However, their sensitive ears are particularly vulnerable to loud sounds.Grimlock CR 1/4 Medium Humanoid Armor Class 11Hit Points 17Speed 30 ft.Perception 11 Stealth 13Vulnerable thunder | deafenedSenses keensense 30 ft.

The grimlock reaches into a pocket, pulls out a small object, and throws it at a creature the grimlock can sense within 30 feet. The grimlock chooses one of the following objects:• Flashing Rock. The grimlock throws a scintillating rock at the target that bursts with a myriad of colors. The target must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or be blinded until the end of its next turn.• Illusory Dancer. The grimlock throws a small disk that emits a blurry, fractured illusion of a graceful, humanoid dancer. The target must succeed on a DC 11 CHA save or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn as it is mesmerized by the dance.Black Flag Roleplaying 116• Whirling Death. The grimlock throws a small, bladed gear that grows larger and larger as it travels toward the tar\u0002get, threatening to slice the target into pieces. The target must succeed on a DC 11 WIS save or be frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target realizes the gear’s growth was a magical, illusory effect and that the gear never increased in size.HarpyWith the body of a woman and the wings and talons of a swift raptor, this monstrosity slashes the air as she dives at prey. Often, a harpy strikes with a deadly song on her lips.Harpies dwell in dark forests and along coastlines, building their eyries in high places to protect their young. Dangerous hunters with a taste for human and giant flesh, they lure prey to its doom using their magical voices or descend upon it with talon and claw.Agents of the Divine. Though loathed now, harpies were once the favored messengers of the gods until some now-forgotten transgression exiled them from the divine realms. Harpies claim they have no stories or legends of that time.Clamor Eyries. Harpies live in large flocks of six to ten mated pairs and their children. A typical clamor is led by the strongest hunters or most powerful singers.Urban Harpies. A few harpies have found acceptance in large urban centers. They trade their aerial speed or magical songs for coins.Harpy CR 1 Medium MonstrosityArmor Class 13Hit Points 38Speed 20 ft., fly 40 ft.Perception 10 Stealth 13 Resistant charmed | Monstrosity ResilienceSenses darkvision 120 ft.Languages Common\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+1 +3 +1 −2 +0 +1\nMonstrosity Resilience.

If both Screech attacks hit one Giant or Humanoid, the target has disadvantage on the next save it makes against the harpy’s Luring Song before the start of the harpy’s next turn.Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.Screech. Ranged Spell Attack: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d6 + 1) thunder damage.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nLuring Song. The harpy sings a magical melody. Every Humanoid and Giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 WIS save or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the save. A charmed target can also repeat the save at the end of each of its turns. If the save is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s song for the next 24 hours.Hell HoundBrimstone permeates the air around this hulking canine. The beast’s claws are curved daggers, its eyes shine with a burning radiance, and flames curl out of its fanged mouth.Hellhounds are fiends punished by their kin and forcibly transformed into the shape of a beast. They roam the infernal realms in cruel packs or serve whatever masters they hope will restore them to original forms.Infernal Guardians. Hellhounds are often encountered near sites important to evil creatures or demonic incursions. Greater demons give mortal supplicants the service of hellhounds as a reward, though it also helps the demon to watch over them.No Mere Beast. Despite their shape and other bestial instincts, hellhounds are still fiends, and they retain most of their intellect and cruel cunning. Opponents who expect them to act like hounds seldom discover their error before they are consumed. They prefer to fight in great numbers, and when they begin a hunt, very little dissuades them.Hell Hound CR 3Medium Fiend (Outsider)Armor Class 15 (natural armor)Hit Points 76Speed 50 ft.Perception 15 Stealth 11Immune fire | charmed, frightenedSenses darkvision 60 ft.Languages understands Infernal but can’t speak117 Chaptier 5: Monsters\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+5 +1 +2 −2 +3 −2\nPack Tactics.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 DEX save, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.HippogriffFlashing down from the sky, this creature has the body and rear legs of a horse, but the head, wings, and forelegs of a mighty eagle. With a raptor’s scream, it dives to strike.The swift hippogriffs hunt the mountain steppes, plains, and wild places of the world. They are omnivorous but prefer meat. A single hippogriff considers an extremely wide swath as its hunting territory and remains in an area until the food supply is exhausted.Eternal Mates. Hippogriffs mate for life, raising one to two young at a time. They lay eggs, taking turns watching over them (or hatchlings) while the other mate hunts for food. When a hippogriff dies, its mate often starves itself to death.Loyal Steeds. Hippogriff eggs are prized treasures and valuable to everyone from elven lords to powerful human generals. A single egg is valued at 2,000 gp. Of all the monstrous mounts, hippogriffs are the easiest to train. However, the death of a hippogriff ’s rider sends the mount into a frenzy.Hippogriff CR 1 Large Monstrosity (Animal)Armor Class 11Hit Points 44 Speed 40 ft., fly 60 ft.Perception 13 Stealth 10 Resistant Monstrosity ResilienceSenses —Languages —\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+3 +1 +1 −4 +3 −1\nHeightened Sight.

They have red eyes and reptilian tails, and though only the size of gnomes, they hold their weapons with easy familiarity.Kobolds are diligent, hardworking creatures who view life through a practical lens. They instinctively conform to the wishes of anyone stronger than themselves rather than risk confrontation. Kobolds can be found in dark forests, deep underground, and in the heart of urban centers.Clever Miners. Skilled miners and inordinately clever with mechanical devices, kobolds routinely surround their warrens with traps, deadfalls, and camouflage.Collective Community. Kobolds share a strong communal instinct, knowing that only by acting together can they hope to defeat threats against them. When kobolds travel with other lineages, they extend this spirit to their companions.Talented Witches and Alchemists. Kobolds collect items thrown away by dwarves, humans, and others and use them in strange brews and potions.Kobold CR 1/8Small Humanoid Armor Class 12Hit Points 9Speed 30 ft.Perception 8 Stealth 14 Senses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Common, DraconicBlack Flag Roleplaying 118\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n−2 +4 −1 −1 −2 −1\nPack Tactics.

The kobold moves up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. If the kobold is aware of traps in the area, the kobold can choose if this movement triggers any of them.MimicA hateful crimson eye opens on the surface of the otherwise innocuous barrel. Then another eye opens, and another still. With startling speed, the barrel becomes a pseudopod-wielding horror, its toothy maw opening wide.The dungeon delver’s bane, a mimic is a stealthy predator that transforms itself into an inanimate object, perfectly copying the appearance of wood or stone. It typically poses as furniture, doors, stairs, and the like. In its natural form, it resembles an amorphous blob with flesh-like protrusions resembling objects it previously copied.Deceptive Hunters.While not terribly intelligent, mimics are uncanny predators. They lurk in well trafficked areas of dungeons, wildernesses, or urban environments, assuming shapes intended to lure prey. They then use their sticky adhesive skin to trap their next meal.Taste Focused. Mimics are supremely patient, but they are obsessed with consuming prey to relish the taste, not necessarily to sate hunger. The taste buds of a mimic’s tongue are extremely sensitive, and they gather a great deal of information with every bite.Mimic CR 2Medium Monstrosity (Shapechanger)Armor Class 12 (natural armor)Hit Points 58Speed 20 ft.Perception 11 Stealth 13 Vulnerable coldResistant grappled | Monstrosity ResilienceImmune acid | proneSenses keensense 60 ft.Languages —\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+3 +1 +2 −3 +1 −1\nAdhesive (Object Form Only). The mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 13). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.False Appearance (Object Form Only). While the mimic remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.Grappler. The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by it.Monstrosity Resilience. The mimic is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition. \n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The mimic makes two Pseudopod attacks. If it is grappling a creature, it can replace one attack with a Bite attack.Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage.Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the mimic is in object form, the target is subjected to its Adhesive trait. \n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nChange Shape. The mimic transforms into a Large or smaller object or back into its true, amorphous form, which is a Monstrosity. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\n\nREACTIONS\nPrey Shield. When a creature the mimic can see hits it with an attack while it is grappling a creature, the mimic can roll the grappled creature in front of the blow, forcing the grappled creature to take the damage instead.MycolidThis small living fungus has the white fibrous stalk and soft, spongy head of a mushroom. Beneath its wide, bell-shaped cap, humanoid arms clutch ramshackle gardening instruments and crude weapons, while flat leg-stalks move the plant-creature toward any potential threats.Mycolids sprout in areas infused with unnatural magical energy, such as the fetid bog of a black dragon, the cavernous ruins of the underworld, or the shady glade blessed by an archfey or druid. Regardless of region or 119 Chaptier 5: Monstersclimate, commoner myconids spend most of their lives cultivating a huge variety of mushrooms into a single unbroken chain of interconnected growth.Community First. They thrive in harsh environments without thought for shelter, culture, art, or history, and instead pour every moment of their relatively short lives into expanding the colony. Few creatures attack the peaceful fungal folk, but those that do find their woody bodies, soft, springy heads, and immunity to pain difficultto overcome. When a colony is threatened, every commoner mycolid fights to the death to protect the collective.Highly Toxic. Though commoner mycolids are safe to handle, creatures foolish enough to eat one may succumb to their potent toxins. In extreme situations, mycolids may let themselves be eaten to kill massive or dangerous creatures and add fertilizer to the colony. Mycolids spores are a powerful defense mechanism as well, and older mycolids have more powerful spores. Even newborn commoner mycolid spores can addle the mind of most beasts.Shared Memory. Each mycolid is a clone of a single progenitor called a spore lord. A family of like mycolids, the spawn of an individual spore lord, is called a “ring,” and each ring shares a collective pool of memories and consciousness connected to a mycelial network. As such, mycolids remember their own births as though they tended to their younger selves personally and can recall every birth and death since the ring began. Though all members of a ring look identical, no two rings are exactly alike. Separate rings cannot share thoughts or memories, but all mycolids can communicate telepathically over short distances.Spore Lord. When a safe area of rich, damp fertilizer can be secured, a commoner mycolid may undergo a rapid change into a more powerful form capable of using its spores to create a near-endless supply of identical offspring. This form, called a spore lord, does not rule over other mycolids. But while commoners tend to the health of mushrooms and mycolid sprouts, spore lords protect the colony from threats and supply it with a stream of clones. A single spore lord might create dozens or hundreds of clones of itself in its lifetime, and a dozen spore lords from different colonies may amass in a single fertile location without conflict.Magic Channelers. Upon transformation, a spore lord is made larger, stronger, and smarter by the primal magic that spawned it. Spore lords instinctively know how to manipulate the environment through cultivation and magic.Communal Knowledge. All members of a spore lord’s ring share its memories, but commoners lack the capacity to understand how and why the spore lord is different, though they recognize it. Only when separated from the colony can a commoner reach such an understanding, usually moments before it changes into a spore lord itself.Mycolid Commoner CR 1/2Small PlantArmor Class 12Hit Points 22Speed 15 ft.Perception 13 Stealth 14 Resistant poison | Plant ResilienceSenses keensense 120 ft.

The mycolid can pinpoint the location of each friendly mycolid within 120 feet of it. In addition, its telepathy range increases to 120 feet when communicating with other mycolids.Plant Resilience. The mycolid is resistant to exhaustion and to the paralyzed, petrified, and unconscious conditions. \n\nACTIONS\nGardening Pick. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.Slowing Spores (Recharge 5–6). The mycolid ejects slowing spores from its body. Each creature that isn’t a mycolid within 5 feet of the mycolid must make a DC 13 WIS save. On a failure, a creature takes 5 (2d4) poison damage and is slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t slowed. A slowed creature’s speed is halved, and it can’t take reactions.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nFetid Feast. The mycolid draws sustenance from a Medium or larger pile of carrion or rotting vegetation within 5 feet of it. It regains 5 (2d4) HP.

Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) poison damage, and the sap sticks to the target. While the sap is stuck, the target takes 4 (1d8) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can use an action to scrape away the sap, ending the effect.Mushroom Ring (Recharge 5–6). The spore lord causes fungal growth to erupt from a point on the ground it can sense within 120 feet of it. A ring of mushrooms sprouts in a 15-foot radius around that point. Each creature that isn’t a mycolid within that ring must make a DC 14 CON save, taking 13 (3d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each mycolid within that ring gains 5 (2d4) temporary HP.Slumber Spores (Recharge 5–6). The spore lord ejects sleep-inducing spores from its body. Each creature that isn’t a mycolid within 10 feet of the spore lord must make a DC 14 WIS save. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and falls unconscious for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t fall unconscious. The unconscious creature wakes if it takes damage or if a creature uses an action to wake it.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nFetid Feast. The spore lord draws sustenance from a Medium or larger pile of carrion or rotting vegetation within 5 feet of it. It regains 7 (2d6) HP. The spore lord can’t use Fetid Feast on a pile of carrion or vegetation if it or another mycolid has already used Fetid Feast on that pile.OrcA gray-skinned humanoid glares with red-rimmed eyes. He brandishes his axe and growls, his tusked mouth twisting into a toothy snarl as he advances.Orcs are broad and muscular, with coarse features, prominent tusks on their lower jaws, and deeply set eyes. They commonly have a dusky gray skin color, though this can vary by region or tribe, with tones ranging from pale white to sandy or even mottled white and black, with a few sporting greenish or orange tinges.Rule of Might. Aggressive, opportunistic warriors, orcs follow the rule of might. In orcish culture, you are entitled to whatever you can take, for however long you are strong enough to hold it. Tribes choose homes based on the other creatures that live nearby and what they have worth taking, even if those others are another orc tribe.Great War Banners. Occasionally, tribes band together under the banner of a leader of exceptional might, a Great Chief, to take some great prize. Such hordes rarely last beyond the initial raid, with each tribe seizing its share and returning home to celebrate victory.Orc CR 1/2 Medium Humanoid Armor Class 13 (hide armor)Hit Points 25Speed 30 ft.Perception 10 Stealth 11 Senses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Common, Orc\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+3 +1 +3 −2 +0 +0\nRelentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).

The orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.121 Chaptier 5: MonstersOtyughAn enormous mound rises from the muck, grasping with its tentacles as a massive, toothy maw opens on its front.This bizarre creature’s body is a shapeless mass of flesh atop three thick fins. Three tentacles sprout from the body, two longer ones ending in spiky, grasping pads, and a third, shorter limb bearing the otyugh’s eyes and nostrils. Much of the creature’s front side is taken up by a cavernous mouth filled with sharp teeth.Adaptable Appetites. Otyughs are omnivorous, eating anything organic and delighting in rot, waste, and carrion. Their constant hunger extends to living creatures as well. They hide while submerged in water or bury themselves in mud or filth, lashing out at potential prey as they pass.Damp Dwellers. Otyughs prefer wet environs, lairing in swamps, rainforests, partially flooded caves, or other wilderness areas prone to damp and decay. They can also be found in populated areas. City sewers, village middens, or boneyards contain what these sewer horrors view as abundant sources of food.Otyugh CR 5Large AberrationArmor Class 14 (natural armor)Hit Points 108Speed 30 ft.Perception 11 Stealth 10 Resistant Aberrant ResilienceImmune poison | poisonedSenses darkvision 120 ft.Languages Otyugh\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+3 +0 +7 −2 +1 −2\nAberrant Resilience.

This form of telepathy doesn’t allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.Stench. Each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the otyugh must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The otyugh makes one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks. It can replace both Tentacle attacks with a use of Tentacle Slam.Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or become infected with a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target is poisoned. Every 24 hours that elapse, the infected creature must repeat the save, reducing its HP maximum by 5 (1d10) no a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The creature dies if the disease reduces its HP maximum to 0. This reduction to the creature’s HP maximum lasts until it finishes a long rest after the disease is cured.Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13).

On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.OwlbearBursting from the forest undergrowth, a massive creature—equal parts bear and raptor—gives a roaring screech as it charges.Vicious carnivores, owlbears devour vast amounts of deer, boar, and other creatures in the forests they inhabit—and vomit up distinctive bezoars of undigested bone, hide, and feathers. An owlbear has the shape and mass of a grizzly bear, with a thick coat of fur intermixed with feathers. The massive body is topped with a great, owl-like head, complete with large, round eyes and a curved, hooked beak that can grip and tear its prey. Though incapable of flight, the owlbear’s limbs are covered with enough feathers for gliding when it leaps from sufficiently high cliffs and hills.Territorial. Territorial and testy, owlbears are quick to challenge interlopers in their domain. An owlbear faces larger or more numerous opponents with undaunted savagery that often scares off larger and even more powerful foes.Nesting. Normally solitary, owlbears remain together only to rear their hatchlings until they are old enough to fend for themselves. Mated pairs sometimes build an enormous stick-nest in a cavern or on a rocky spire. An angry owlbear defending its eggs or young is especially dangerous.Tribal Guardians. Despite their hostility, humanoid tribes sometimes capture owlbear hatchlings or eggs, raising them as fearsome guardians or mounts. Dwarves have also been known to keep owlbears as guards.Black Flag Roleplaying 122Owlbear CR 3Large Monstrosity (Animal)Armor Class 14 (natural armor)Hit Points 80Speed 40 ft.Perception 13 Stealth 11Resistant Monstrosity Resilience Senses darkvision 60 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+5 +1 +3 −4 +1 −2\nGlide.

It can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it falls. The owlbear can’t gain height with its gliding feathers alone. If subjected to a strong wind or lift of any kind, it can use the updraft to glide farther.Heightened Sight and Smell. The owlbear’s Perception is 18 when perceiving by sight or smell.Monstrosity Resilience. The owlbear is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition. \n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The owlbear makes one Beak attack and one Claw attack. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 15).Beak.

Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.Vicious Bound (44 HP or Fewer). The owlbear roars and barrels through creatures. It moves up to 20 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Medium or smaller creature. The first time it enters a creature’s space during this move, that creature must make a DC 15 STR save. On a failure, a creature takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nRend. The owlbear violently wrenches a Medium or smaller creature it is currently grappling. The target must make a DC 15 STR save, taking 9 (2d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.PegasusA noble flying horse, its coat shining like newly fallen snow, soars overhead on majestic, feathered wings, mane and tail streaming behind it.Free-spirited creatures, pegasi soar the skies with wild dignity. Ranging far from civilization, pegasi are comfortable only in the presence of their own kind. Intruders cause them to take wing quickly to find more secluded surroundings. Their diet is similar to mundane horses, feeding on grass and flowers in alpine meadows and taking water from mountain streams and high lakes.Mountain Nests. Fiercely protective of their young, pegasi build nests in rocky hills, atop spires and peaks inaccessible to most creatures without the power of flight. When the young are ready to leave the nest, the entire herd watches over and protects them until they reach adulthood.Heroic Servitors. Pegasi are intelligent, autonomous, and untamable. However, a being of pure heart and good intent can sometimes convince a pegasus to become its companion, especially if the being is in desperate need or faces some monumental task, such as thwarting those with evil motives.Pegasus CR 2 Large Celestial (Animal)Armor Class 12Hit Points 57Speed 60 ft., fly 90 ft.Perception 12 Stealth 12 Resistant Celestial ResilienceImmune charmedSenses —Languages understands Celestial, Common, Elvish, and Sylvan but can’t speak\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+4 +2 +3 +0 +2 +1\nCelestial Resilience.

Its vast, toothy maw is large enough to swallow a horse whole.Truly the rulers of their domains, purple worms claim the Underworld as their hunting grounds. These tremendous monsters can bore through solid rock, creating new tunnels and passageways as they travel. Any creature a purple worm encounters besides another of its kind is prey.Follow Prey by Sound. Purple worms are attracted by sound and vibration, leading most subterranean humanoids to travel as quietly as possible and ensure that battles are short and decisive. Major settlements in the Underworld have contingencies in place for a purple worm attack.Gemstones and Ore. A purple worm digests the earth and rock it ingests while tunneling, excreting it along the tunnels it creates and in the caverns where it rests. In mineral-rich areas, brave souls may find undigested gems and unrefined ores among a purple worm’s waste, or even inside its body if they are mighty enough to defeat it.Purple Worm CR 15 Gargantuan MonstrosityArmor Class 18 (natural armor)Hit Points 255Speed 50 ft., burrow 30 ft.Perception 14 Stealth 8 Resistant Monstrosity ResilienceImmune proneSenses keensense 60 ft., tremorsense 60 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+9 −2 +11 −5 +4 −3\nMonstrosity Resilience. The purple worm is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition. Tunneler. A purple worm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed. Doing so creates a 10-foot-diameter tunnel behind it.\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The worm makes one Bite attack and one Tail Stinger attack.Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must make a DC 19 DEX save or be swallowed by the purple worm. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside of the worm, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worm’s turns.  If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 CON save at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.Tail Stinger. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 19 CON save, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.Thrash (Recharge 5–6). The purple worm convulses its large body, smashing everything around it. Each creature within 20 feet of the worm must make a DC 19 STR save. On a failure, a creature takes 54 (12d8) bludgeoning damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nRapid Digestion. The purple worm’s digestive system absorbs some of the already digested material from creatures it has swallowed. If the purple worm has at least one swallowed creature inside it, the purple worm regains 9 (2d8) HP. This healing increases by 4 (1d8) for each creature currently inside the purple worm, to a maximum of 10d8.Rust MonsterA strange, insectile creature skitters forward on four legs. It waves two large, feathery antennae about in a questing manner.As its name implies, this odd creature can rust ferrous metals, allowing it to eat the oxidized results. The rust monster roams caves and tunnels seeking out such metals. When it finds it, the creature aggressively rushes to devour the meal. Because rust monsters have a basic, animalistic intelligence, an adventurer can save their sword or shield by distracting the creature with another source of metal.Armored Shell. A rust monster is about the size of a large dog. It has an insectile appearance, with armored plates like an exoskeleton. It has segmented legs but, unlike an insect, only four of them. It has a thin, whip-like tail that thrashes when the creature is agitated or catches the scent of metals.Color Matches Diet. The coloration of its hide varies depending on its diet. A rust monster whose diet includes large amounts of mithral would have a silvery sheen to its hide, for example.Rust Monster CR 1/2Medium MonstrosityArmor Class 14 (natural armor)Hit Points 25Speed 40 ft.Black Flag Roleplaying 124Perception 11 Stealth 13 Resistant Monstrosity ResilienceSenses darkvision 60 ft., tremorsense 30 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+1 +1 +1 −4 +1 −2\nIron Scent. The rust monster can pinpoint, by scent, the location of ferrous metal within 30 feet of it.Monstrosity Resilience. The rust monster is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition. Rust Metal. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the rust monster corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the rust monster is destroyed after dealing damage.Spider Climb. The rust monster can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.\n\nACTIONS\nBite. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d6 + 1) piercing damage.Antennae. The rust monster corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11 DEX save to avoid the rust monster’s touch. If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.SkeletonHalf hidden in darkness, skeletal bones clad in rusted armor and rotten clothing lurch toward you. The thing’s bony hands grip a sword with malign intent.Skeletons are fleshless undead that have been reconstructed and animated by fell magic. Soulless, emotionless, and driven by the whims of their master, the skeleton is an unshakable guardian. Skeletons can be found in desecrated temples, graveyards, and cemeteries where they can watch, completely motionless, for eons. New and masterful necromancers use skeletons as stalwart guards and servants, though they understand such creatures have no loyalty beyond the magic that controls them.Dark Intelligence. While lacking humanoid intelligence, skeletons possess a cleverness that extends beyond a mere beast or construct. Their malicious minds remember how to wield weapons and armor, and they collect and use weapons or shields taken from the recent dead. Skeletons look upon the living with eyeless sockets and unsettling patience as their instincts judge distances, tactics, and methods to separate a potential target’s flesh from their bones.Moldering Bodies. Though dried strands of tendon or wisps of stubborn hair may cling to a skeleton, magic alone is responsible for its movement. Piercing weapons and arrows may skip from the skeleton’s hardened bone, but heavy blows shatter them.Skeleton CR 1/4 Medium Undead Armor Class 13 (armor scraps)Hit Points 14Speed 30 ft.Perception 9 Stealth 14Vulnerable bludgeoningResistant piercing Immune Undead ResilienceSenses darkvision 60 ft.Languages understands all languages it knew in life but can’t speak\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+0 +2 +2 −2 −1 −3\nFalse Appearance.

When a creature the warhorse skeleton can see hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it, the skeleton can make one Hooves attack against the attacker.SporebornA low hiss emerges from the shambling form crowned with fleshy fungal growth.The sporeborn are humanoid creatures transformed by an infectious fungus, which takes control of victims and uses them as a vehicle to spread its spores into other hosts. The apocalyptic fungus has no real intelligence, only a drive to reproduce. Humanoids can be infected by the fungus through contaminated food or water, breathing the spore clouds, or the bite of an infected host.Stages of Infection. Creatures infected by the apocalyptic fungus go through different stages of infection before they ultimately expire. Most die before reaching the final stage, though the fungus in their bodies continues to grow, dissolving the host’s remains. If the host body sustains serious damage or can no longer move easily, the fungus attempts to move into a dark, sheltered area so that, as the body decays, the fungus fruits and releases its spores. Sunlight kills the fungus and its spores.Skullblooms. Infected humanoids that succumb to the fungus become sporeborn skullblooms. Skullblooms show physical signs of their transformation, as the spores inside the host’s brain sprout into spongy stalks that break through the skull to crown the head, while patches of fungus break through the cheeks and around the eye sockets and random areas of the body. Skullblooms stalk or ambush victims and use cooperative tactics, such as herding potential victims toward other skullblooms lying in wait. Sometimes skullblooms enter periods of inertia, lying down or leaning up against a wall or tree and allowing the fungus to spread over them, only to burst out and attack when a potential target passes by.Bloatblossoms. Skullblooms eventually grow into bloatblossoms. A riot of fungal growth makes the body of these sporeborn broad and ungainly, with layers of tough, fibrous growth that protect it from damage. Bloatblossoms have better echolocation than the younger skullblooms, as well as nodules filled with mycotoxins that they can tear from their bodies and hurl at targets.Skullbloom CR 1/2 Medium PlantArmor Class 11 (natural armor)Hit Points 23Speed 30 ft.Perception 11 Stealth 12 Resistant Plant ResilienceSenses keensense 10 ft.Languages understands the languages it knew in life but can’t speak\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+2 +0 +2 −4 −1 −3\nHeightened Hearing.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13).Toxic Nodule. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nInstinct to Pursue. The bloatblossom takes the Dash action toward an uninfected Humanoid it can see or sense.SpriteThe sound of buzzing wings whines nearby. A tiny humanoid, held aloft on dragonfly wings, appears as though from thin air.Sprites are diminutive fey that protect the deepest forests and the holiest glades. Attentive and well trained in guerrilla tactics, sprites are among the most aggressive and loyal fey. They may appear to travelers and parlay, uncovering interlopers’ intentions with their Heart Sight and acting against those whose intentions are suspect.Unseen Warriors. Sprites travel through the forest in bands of six to one hundred. They mask their numbers using their diminutive size and natural ability to turn invisible. Though sprites have been known to turn would-be trespassers away from their forest homes with traps, noises, or theatrical distractions, they are armed with arrows that can put creatures into a deep sleep. While their quarry sleeps, they may fetch a far more dangerous threat, retreat, or signal for reinforcements to dissuade further hostility.Stern Protectors. Unlike many fey, sprites are serious, even-tempered, and intent on doing as little harm as possible. Those they judge worthy might find themselves protected within the sprites’ territory, while those found wanting could walk headlong into ambushes, traps, and enraged beasts. Sprites refrain from tricks and mischief but suffer no evil within their domains.Sprite CR 1/4 Tiny Fey Armor Class 14 (leather armor)Hit Points 13Speed 10 ft., fly 40 ft.Perception 11 Stealth 17Resistant Fey ResilienceSenses —Languages Common, Elvish, Sylvan\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n−4 +3 +0 +2 +1 +0\nFey Resilience.

Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.Shortbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or become poisoned for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it \n\nAPOCALYPTICFUNGUS\nDiseaseAn infectious disease transmitted via fungal spores. Infected creatures become irritable and sensitive to noise. In the final stages, fibrous fungal growths sprout from the skin—particularly around the cranium. If left untreated, infected creatures turn into sporeborn skullblooms. Trigger: A humanoid that ingests food or water contaminated with the spores of the apocalyptic fungus, breathes in the spores, or is bitten by an infected creature must make a DC 12 CON save or become infected. Effects: An infected target can’t regain hit points and when it finishes a long rest must make a DC 15 CON save or gain two levels of exhaustion. When the infected target reaches the sixth level of exhaustion, it does not die but instead becomes a skullbloom, at which point no mundane or magical healing can return the creature to its former state. If a humanoid infected with apocalyptic fungal spores is killed, it rises an hour later as a skullbloom.Resolution: Pre-transformation, the fungal infection can only be cured by the lesser restoration spell or similar magic.127 Chaptier 5: Monsterstakes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.Invisibility. The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nHeart Sight. The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature’s current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 13 CHA save, the sprite also knows if the creature has malign intentions or intends to commit malevolent acts within the next hour. Celestials, Fiends, and Undead automatically fail the save.Swift Flight. The sprite moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.Star CrowA tiny, pulsing mote weaves through the night. As it approaches, its phosphorescent glow slowly dims into blackness. Seconds later, the thing erupts with a blinding flash.Star crows are tiny, formless alien beings that lack sentience or emotion. These glowing creatures are drawn to sentient beings, feeding ravenously on the beings’ thoughts. They have also been known to carry and transfer memories of one sentient creature to another. Star crows transmit these thoughts as a powerful illusory experience, a pastiche of raw emotion, color, images, and sounds. Some star crows bear the wisdom of primordial beings, while others deliver incomprehensible knowledge.Immortal. Star crows have an infinite lifespan. They do not age and do not require food, water, air, or rest. The memories each star crow carries degrade, combine, or interlace with the eons of visions a single star crow may possess. A star crow reproduces by splitting, making a perfect copy of itself, when it acquires too many memories to handle without corruption. A newly spawned star crow assumes about a fourth of the information, lessening the burden of its parent.Star Crow CR 1/4 Tiny AberrationArmor Class 15 (natural armor)Hit Points 12Speed 20 ft., fly 60 ft.

The star crow is resistant to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, and it has advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form. Illumination. The star crow sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\n\nACTIONS\nRadiant Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) radiant damage, and the star crow attaches to the target. While attached, the star crow can use only the Thought Share action and Blinding Burst bonus action, and it moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the star crow’s movement. The star crow can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the star crow by succeeding on a DC 13 STR check.Thought Share. The star crow learns some of the attached target’s memories, and the attached target experiences a rapid sequence of memories from other creatures the star crow has encountered. The target takes 5 (2d4) psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 13 CHA save or be stunned until the end of its next turn.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nBlinding Burst (Recharge 5–6). The star crow dims then suddenly bursts with blinding light. Each creature within 30 feet of the star crow must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be blinded until the end of its next turn.TrollThis hunched giant stares hungrily with wide eyes. Baring massive fangs, it reaches out with long, hooked claws.Trolls stand about 15 feet tall, seeming shorter due to their bowed legs and stooped postures. Long arms end in wicked, curved claws that scrape the ground when the troll moves. Powerful, fang-filled jaws sit below long, broad noses and massive, bloodshot eyes.Variable Appearance. Troll appearance varies widely, and they are prone to a variety of cosmetic mutations. Skin tones and body types include scaled or slimy, broad and rangy, and even somewhat twiggy or stonelike in some cases. Some sport shaggy mops of hair and even beards, while others are completely hairless.Bullies. Trolls are natural bullies, killing to sate their appetites. They enjoy extorting food and wealth from weaker creatures through threats of violence.Regeneration. The troll’s most notable feature is its powerful regenerative capabilities. Given time, a troll Black Flag Roleplaying 128can recover from nearly any wound, even complete dismemberment or beheading. Only wounds delivered with acid or fire can overcome a troll’s regeneration.Troll CR 5 Large Giant Armor Class 15 (natural armor)Hit Points 94Speed 30 ft.Perception 12 Stealth 13 Vulnerable Giant AttributesResistant Giant AttributesSenses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Giant\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+4 +1 +5 −2 −1 −2\nGiant Attributes. The troll is resistant to the stunned condition, and it is vulnerable to the prone condition. Heightened Smell. The troll’s Perception is 17 while perceiving by smell.Regeneration. The troll regains 10 HP at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the troll’s next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 HP and doesn’t regenerate.\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The troll makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nFrenzy (52 HP or Fewer). Desperate for a meal as its injuries mount, the troll moves up to half its speed and makes one Bite attack against a creature it can see within range. The troll then regains HP equal to half the damage dealt.WorgA canine as large as a horse bears down, its oily muzzle caked in blood and saliva. Its thick, heavy shoulders and massive neck sway side to side, and with each step, its long, mangy tail drags along behind it.An enormous creature resembling a wolf, worgs are nightmarish hunters with a taste for humanoid flesh. They willingly stalk inhospitable terrain in their endless hunt for their next meal, roaming snow fields, volcanic barrens, even stony badlands. Known to collect grisly bounties and to coat their bodies with fetid remains, worgs are more ferocious than any natural beast.Warren Dweller. Worgs often shelter in warrens, tunnels, and caves in which they can travel quickly to prey and away from predators. Such places are fetid, vile places full of half-eaten corpses that the worg seems to have gorged itself on without consequence.Willing Mounts. While many beasts of burden must be trained to hold a rider, worgs tend to willingly carry goblins, who share a great number of similarities to the worg, and use the smaller creatures to find more bountiful humanoid prey. Possessing surprising intelligence, worgs have learned to speak Goblin as well as their own guttural language. On rare occasions, worgs have even learned to speak and understand Common or Elvish.Worg CR 1/2Large Monstrosity (Animal)Armor Class 13 (natural armor)Hit Points 25Speed 30 ft.Perception 14 Stealth 13 Resistant Monstrosity ResilienceSenses darkvision 60 ft.Languages Goblin, Worg\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+3 +1 +1 −2 +0 −1\nHeightened Hearing and Smell.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nLoathsome Howl (1/Day). The worg unleashes an unnatural howl audible out to a distance of 300 feet. Each creature of the worg’s choice within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 CHA save or be frightened of it for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Until it finishes a long rest, the worg can sense the direction but not the exact location of each creature that was frightened by Loathsome Howl.129 Chaptier 5: MonstersZombieA rotting corpse shambles forward, arms outstretched and flailing.Zombies are the animated corpses of the dead, brought to unlife by necromantic magic, creating tireless, fearless servants that obey without hesitation. Occasionally, zombies are produced by other methods. Victims of wights, for example, often rise as zombies under command of the undead that killed them. Sometimes an enduring source of necromantic magic corrupts an area, causing nearby corpses to spontaneously rise as zombies.Decayed Corpses. The appearance of zombies varies widely, depending upon the condition of the corpse prior to animation. A corpse dead from natural causes and stolen from an undertaker may be well-preserved, if obviously not alive, while a zombie animated from a drowning victim is bloated and sagging. Some necromancers use whatever is at hand. Others may choose the most disgusting corpses to add an additional fear factor for those that must face the zombies in combat.Dim Intellect. Zombies have no personality and little intellect, following only the most basic commands. They can wield weapons if armed but simply batter an opponent with its limbs if not. They do not have the intellect to avoid even obvious hazards, shambling into open pits if they exist between them and a target or walking heedlessly through a fire to attack, unless commanded otherwise in that moment. When not under specific orders, a zombie simply stands awaiting commands, though if a living creature comes close enough for it to detect, it attacks, as the dark magics animating a zombie make it malicious toward the living.Non-Human Zombies. Zombies are most commonly animated human remains, but the flesh of any living thing can be animated as a zombie. Zombie giants, for example, would be stronger and harder to kill than a human zombie. They would attack like other zombies, though they could throw rocks like a living giant if commanded to do so. Non\u0002humanoid zombies typically attack as they did when living. A zombie dragon, for example, would attack with claws and teeth, and it could still fly if its wings were intact.Zombie CR 1/4 Medium UndeadArmor Class 8Hit Points 16Speed 20 ft.Perception 10 Stealth 8 Immune Undead ResilienceSenses darkvision 60 ft.Languages understands the languages it knew in life but can’t speak\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n\n+2 −2 +3 −4 +0 −3\nUndead Fortitude.

The ogre shoulders its weapon and charges forward, shoving into creatures on its way. It moves up to 20 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Medium or smaller creature. The first time it enters a creature’s space during this move, that creature must make a DC 14 STR save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.AnimalsThis section contains statistics for various animals.

        "CHAPTER 3: EQUIPMENT & MAGIC ITEMS\nEquipment\nThis section covers the standard nonmagical equipment \navailable and the rules concerning their use.\nARMOR\nWearing armor increases your armor class (AC), which \nin turn increases your chance of avoiding enemy attacks. \nWhen an enemy attempts an attack, their attack roll total \nmust meet or beat your AC to deal damage. So, the higher \nyour AC, the greater the chance of avoiding damage! \nThe Armor table lists the cost, AC bonus, weight, special \nproperties, and proficiencies required to successfully use \nthe various kinds of armor.\nARMOR TYPES & PROFICIENCIES\nEach armor is categorized into a type that is associated \nwith a proficiency. For instance, a character with \nproficiency in light armor can wear any of the kinds of \narmor listed in the light armor section of the armor table \nwithout penalty. \nYour character can wear any kind of armor, but if you \ndon’t have proficiency, you have disadvantage on all STR \nand DEX ability checks made while wearing it. It is also \nimpossible to cast spells while wearing armor you aren’t \nproficient with.\nLIGHT ARMOR\nLight armor provides minimal protection while still \nallowing its wearer to move with relative ease. Its flexibility \nmakes it the go-to choice for rogues and other DEX-based \ncharacter builds.\nMEDIUM ARMOR\nMedium armor provides more protection than light armor, \nbut it uses bulkier materials that interfere with range of \nmotion. The additional protection offered by medium \narmor makes it a popular choice for clerics who need to \nbe close enough to the danger to aid their allies, but don’t \nneed to move quickly around the battlefield.\nThis chapter lists the equipment available to PCs and \nexplains additional rules on the topic. It also contains a few \nmagic items PCs might find during their adventures.\nCurrency\nCoins used in the game are minted in precious metals \ngenerally considered valuable by most cultures. This \nstandardization of value is widely accepted, even by \ncommunities that wouldn’t traditionally value such things.\nThe four most common coins are the copper piece (cp), \nthe silver piece (sp), the gold piece (gp), and the platinum \npiece (pp). Average coins weigh less than half an ounce. A \npouch of 50 coins weighs 1 pound.\nCURRENCY CONVERSION\nCOIN CP SP GP PP\nCopper (cp) 1 1/10 1/100 1/1,000\nSilver (sp) 10 1 1/10 1/100\nGold (gp) 100 10 1 1/10\nPlatinum (pp) 1,000 100 10 1\nSelling Nonmagical Items\nMost nonmagical equipment can be resold for half its \noriginal value, assuming it is in good shape. Equipment \nretrieved from the corpses of monsters is rarely in resale \ncondition. \nNonmagical treasures like cut gemstones, works of art, or \nfine jewelry can generally be resold at full price.\nFor rules on buying and selling magic items, see the Magic \nItems section later in this chapter.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 48\nHEAVY ARMOR\nHeavy armor provides the most protection of any armor \ntype, but wearing it demands great physical prowess. \nFighters are one of the few character classes that can take \nfull advantage of heavy armor’s defensive capabilities. \nSHIELDS\nShields are a unique type of armor because they are held \ninstead of worn. This means you can lose their AC bonus \nif the shield is destroyed or dropped. Wielding a shield \nrequires the use of one hand, which means a PC can’t use \ntwo-handed weapons while holding a shield. You can only \nbenefit from one shield AC bonus at a time, even while \nholding multiple shields.\nARMOR PROPERTIES\nCertain sets of armor have properties that affect how they \nare used, as shown in the Properties column of the Armor \ntable.\nCumbersome. This armor is heavy and difficult to move in \nunless you possess the required STR. If a player character \ndoes not have a STR score equal to or greater than the \nSTR score listed in parentheses, their movement speed is \nreduced by 10 feet while they wear the armor, even if they \nare proficient with it.\nNatural Materials. This armor does not interfere with a \ndruid’s ability to cast spells. At GM’s discretion, a shield \ncan have this property.\nNoisy. This armor imposes disadvantage on any ability \nchecks made to avoid notice, like sneaking, hiding, or \notherwise attempting to move silently.\nGETTING INTO AND OUT OF ARMOR\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the \narmor’s category.\nDon. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit \nfrom the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don \nthe suit of armor.\nDoff. This is the time it takes to remove armor. If you have \nhelp, reduce this time by half.\nDONNING AND DOFFING ARMOR\nCATEGORY DON DOFF\nLight Armor 1 minute 1 minute\nMedium Armor 5 minutes 1 minute\nHeavy Armor 10 minutes 5 minutes\nShield 1 action 1 action\nARMOR\nARMOR COST AC BONUS WEIGHT PROPERTIES\nLight Armor\n Leather 10 gp 11 + DEX modifier 10 lb.

The table is also split by proficiencies \nrequired (simple and martial) to successfully wield the \nvarious weapons. \nWEAPON TYPES & PROFICIENCIES\nEach weapon is categorized into a type associated with a \nproficiency. For instance, a character with proficiency in \nmartial weapons gets to add their PB to attack rolls made \nwith any weapon listed in the martial weapons section of \nthe Weapons table.\nAny character can wield any weapon, but only a character \nwith proficiency can add their PB to attack rolls with those \nweapons.\nMELEE WEAPONS\nMelee weapons are used to attack nearby targets (typically \nwithin 5 feet).\nRANGED WEAPONS\nRanged weapons are used to attack targets at a distance.\nSIMPLE WEAPONS\nSimple weapons require little experience to use effectively. \nThese weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons \noften found in the hands of commoners.\nMARTIAL WEAPONS\nMartial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, \nrequire more specialized training to use effectively. Most \nwarriors use martial weapons because these weapons tend \nto deal more damage and put their training to best use.\nWEAPON OPTIONS\nThis section offers unique options for using weapons in \nways other than dealing damage, giving different weapons \ndistinct impacts on the battlefield, as shown in the \nWeapons table.\nA character can use a weapon option only if the character \nis wielding and proficient with a weapon. If an option \nrequires a creature to make an ability check or save, the DC \nequals 8 + the attacker’s PB + the attacker’s STR or DEX \nmodifier (attacker’s choice).\nUnless specified otherwise, a weapon used to perform \na weapon option has only the option’s listed effect and \ndoesn’t deal normal weapon damage. If a weapon option \ninstructs a character to make and attack with the weapon, \nand the character can make multiple attacks with the \nAttack action, the weapon option replaces only one of \nthose attacks.\nAt the GM’s discretion, some weapon options might \nnot work against certain creatures. For example, the trip \nweapon option might not work against a creature without \ndiscernable legs, such as an ooze, or that is anchored or \nattached to the ground in some way, such as a tree with \nanimated limbs.\nBASH\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can hit \nthe target in the side of the head or other vital organ, \ndisorienting it for a moment. Make an attack roll with this \nweapon. On a hit, the target is briefly disoriented and has \ndisadvantage on its next attack roll.\nDISARM\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can \nchoose to aim a jarring hit at the target’s held weapon, \nknocking it from their grasp. Make an attack roll with this \nweapon. On a hit, the target must succeed on a STR or \nDEX save (target’s choice) or drop its weapon, which lands \nin an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If no unoccupied \nspace is within range, the weapon lands at the target’s feet.\nIMPROVISED WEAPONS\nSometimes characters don’t have their favorite weapons \nand must fight with whatever’s handy. An improvised \nweapon includes any object you can wield in one or two \nhands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a \nwagon wheel, or a dead goblin.\nWhen in doubt about how much damage an object should \ndeal, find a weapon on the Weapons table most like the \nobject and use its damage die. For example, a table leg is a \nlot like a club. At the GM’s discretion, a character proficient \nwith a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that \nweapon and add their PB as normal.\nIf a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee \nattack or throws a melee weapon that does not have the \nthrown property, those are considered improvised weapons, \nand typically deal 1d4 damage of an appropriate damage \ntype. An improvised thrown weapon typically has range of \n20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 50\nPINNING SHOT\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can \nchoose to shoot part of a Large or smaller creature’s \nclothing and pin the clothing to the ground or nearby \nobject or structure. The target must be wearing clothing, \nsuch as boots or a cloak, and must be on the ground or \nwithin 5 feet of an object or structure. Make an attack roll \nwith this weapon. On a hit, the target can’t move from its \ncurrent space. A creature, including the target, can take its \naction to rip the cloth, pull out the arrow or bolt, unclasp or \nwriggle out of the clothing, or free itself in some other way \nHAMSTRING\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can make \na painful but superficial wound on a leg of a Large or \nsmaller creature. Make an attack roll with this weapon. \nOn a hit, the target’s walking speed is reduced by 10 feet \nfor 1 minute. A creature’s speed can’t be reduced by more \nthan 10 feet with this weapon option. A creature within 5 \nfeet of the target can take an action to tend the wound with \na successful WIS (Medicine) check (against your weapon \noption DC), ending the effect on the target. The effect also \nends if the target receives magical healing.\nWEAPONS\nWEAPON COST DAMAGE WEIGHT WEAPON OPTION PROPERTIES\nSimple Melee Weapons\n Club 1 sp 1d6 bludgeoning 2 lb.

You can use a weapon that has the \nammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you \nhave ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time \nyou attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of \nammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, \ncase, or other container is part of the attack (you need \na free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end \nof an encounter, you can recover half your expended \nammunition by taking 1 minute to search the battlefield.\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to \nmake a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised \nweapon (see Improvised Weapons sidebar). A sling must be \nloaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\nFinesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, \nuse your choice of your STR or DEX modifier for the \nattack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier \nfor both rolls.\nHeavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls \nwith heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make \nit too large for a Small creature to use effectively.\nLight. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making \nit ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.\nLoading. Because of the time required to load this \nweapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it \nwhen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, \nregardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\nRange. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack \nhas a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown \nproperty. The range lists two numbers. The first is the \nweapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates \nthe weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond \nnormal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You \ncan’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.\nReach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you \nattack with it, as well as when determining your reach for \nopportunity attacks with it.\nThrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can \nthrow it to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee \nweapon, use the same ability modifier for that attack roll \nand damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with \nthe weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, use your \nSTR, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your STR \nor your DEX, since the dagger has the finesse property.\nTwo-Handed. This weapon requires you to use two hands \nwhen you attack with it.\nVersatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. \nThese weapons have two damage values listed. The higher \ndamage value is used when you use two hands to make a \nmelee attack.\nby succeeding on a STR or DEX check (target’s choice). \nThe target must make only one check to free itself, using \nthe highest DC of characters performing this weapon \noption, regardless of the number of arrows or bolts \nholding it in place.\nPULL\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can pull \na Large or smaller creature up to 5 feet closer to you as \nyou slide the weapon’s haft around the creature. Make an \nattack roll with this weapon. On a hit, the target is pulled \nup to 5 feet closer to you. If this movement would pull a \ncreature into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, it can \nmake a STR or DEX (target’s choice) save, avoiding the \npull on a success.\nRICOCHET SHOT\nAs an action, you can ricochet an attack off an object \nor structure to hit a target you can see that has half or \nthree-quarters cover. The target must be within 10 feet of \nan object or structure that isn’t providing it with cover, \nand that object or structure must be within your weapon’s \nnormal range. Make an attack roll with this weapon \nagainst the target’s AC as if it weren't behind cover. On a \nhit, the target takes damage as if hit by your attack. This \nweapon option expends the same ammunition as a normal \nattack with this weapon. This attack doesn’t deal extra \ndamage from features such as Sneak Attack, but it can deal \nextra damage from a magical effect on the ammunition, \nsuch as a +1 shortbow or an arrow of slaying.\nTRIP\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can \nchoose to sweep the weapon at a Large or smaller creature’s \nlegs. The target must succeed on a STR or DEX save \n(target’s choice) or fall prone. If the target is mounted, it \nhas advantage on the save.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 52\nADVENTURING GEAR AND TOOLS\nEquipment that is useful for adventurers, but isn’t armor or \nweapons, is called adventuring gear. The Adventuring Gear \ntable lists the price and weight of items commonly available \nfor purchase. Any items that have special rules or require \nfurther explanation are listed in the Special Gear section.\nthe power of arcane circle spells. A wizard can use such an \nitem as a spellcasting focus.\nBall Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal \nballs from a pouch to cover a level, square area that is \n10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered \narea must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or fall prone. A \ncreature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t \nneed to make the save.\nBarding. Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s \nhead, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on \nthe Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is \nfour times the equivalent armor made for humanoids and \nweighs twice as much.\nBook. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, \ninformation pertaining to a particular field of lore, \ndiagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just \nabout anything that can be represented using text or \npictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in \nthis section).\nCaltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops \nto cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature \nthat enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or \nstop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking \nthis damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet \nuntil the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature \nmoving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to \nmake the save.\nCandle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot \nradius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\nCase, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold \nup to ten rolled-up sheets of paper.\nEQUIPMENT PACKS\nThe starting equipment you get from your class includes \na collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a \npack.

A holy symbol is a representation of a god \nor pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol \nrepresenting a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved \nor inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a \nfragment of a sacred relic.

The Mounts table shows \neach animal’s speed and base carrying capacity.\nAn animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon \ncan move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, \nincluding the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull \nthe same vehicle, add their carrying capacity together.\nMounts other than those listed here are available in \nfantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally \navailable for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, \ngriffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic \nmounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such \na mount often means securing an egg and raising the \ncreature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, \nor negotiating with the mount itself.\nVehicle Proficiency. If you have proficiency with a certain \nkind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your PB to any \ncheck you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult \ncircumstances.\nRowed Vessels. Keelboats and rowboats are used on \nlakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of \nthe current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of \nthe vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any \nsignificant current, but they can be pulled upstream by \ndraft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, \nin case adventurers carry it over land.\nMOUNTS\nMOUNT COST\nSPEED (PER \nROUND)\nCARRYING \nCAPACITY\nDonkey or mule 8 gp 40 ft. 420 lb.\nHorse, draft 50 gp 40 ft. 540 lb.\nHorse, riding 75 gp 60 ft. 480 lb.\nMastiff 25 gp 40 ft. 195 lb.\nPony 30 gp 40 ft. 225 lb.\nWarhorse 400 gp 60 ft. 540 lb.\nDRAWN VEHICLES\nITEM COST WEIGHT\nCarriage 100 gp 600 lb.\nCart 15 gp 200 lb.\nChariot 250 gp 100 lb.\nSled 20 gp 300 lb.\nWagon 35 gp 400 lb.\nWATERBORNE VEHICLES\nITEM COST SPEED\nGalley 30,000 gp 4 mph\nKeelboat 3,000 gp 1 mph\nLongship 10,000 gp 3 mph\nRowboat 50 gp 1½ mph\nSailing ship 10,000 gp 2 mph\nWarship 25,000 gp 2½ mph\nFOOD, DRINK, AND LODGING\nThe Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for \nindividual food items and a single night’s lodging.\nFOOD, DRINK, AND LODGING\nITEM COST\nAle\nPitcher (Gallon) 2 sp\nMug 4 cp\nInn stay (per day)\nTypical room 5 sp\nLuxury room 2 gp\nMeals (per day)\nMeal, common 3 sp\nMeal, feast 2 gp\nWine\nCommon (pitcher) 2 sp\nFine (bottle) 10 gp\n57 Chaptier 3: Equipment & Magic Items\nSERVICES\nAdventurers can pay NPCs to assist them or act on their \nbehalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings \nhave fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of \na craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized \nadventuring skills.\nSome basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. \nOther common hirelings include any of the wide variety \nof people who inhabit a typical town or city and whom the \nadventurers pay to perform a specific task. For example, \na wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate \nchest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest \nspell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a \nspecial sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite \nclothing for an upcoming performance for the duke.\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerous \nservices. Mercenary soldiers paid to help take on a \nhobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to \nresearch ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer \nestablishes a stronghold of some kind, they might hire a \nwhole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from \na castellan or steward all the way down to stable cleaners. \nThese hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that \nincludes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the \ncompensation.\nSkilled hirelings include anyone employed to perform \na service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, \ntool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The \npay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require \nmore pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work \nthat requires no particular skill and can include laborers, \nporters, maids, and similar workers.\nMagic Items\nOf the many rewards available to adventurers, magic items \nare perhaps the most coveted. These powerful objects are \ncreated using raw magic and are incredibly complicated to \nproduce. Few beings in the world possess the knowledge \nto make magic items, which makes them hard to find and \nvaluable.\nThe GM is the ultimate arbiter of where magic items \nappear, but they are often given as rewards for crawling \nthrough deadly dungeons or slaying the creatures that \nguard them. \nUSING A MAGIC ITEM\nUsing a magic item’s properties might mean wearing \nor wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be \ndonned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, \ngloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and \nrings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield \nstrapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. \nA weapon must be held.\nIn most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn \ncan fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic \ngarments are made to be easily adjustable, or they \nmagically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions \nexist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit \nonly creatures of a certain size or shape, the GM can rule \nthat it doesn’t adjust. \nWhen a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, it is up \nto GM discretion as to whether the item functions as \nintended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a \nserpentfolk with a tail instead of legs can’t wear boots.\nMULTIPLE ITEMS OF THE SAME KIND\nUse common sense to determine whether more than one \nof a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character \ncan’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one \npair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit \nof armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can \nmake exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet \nunder a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks.\nPAIRED ITEMS\nItems that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, \ngauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both \nitems of the pair are worn. For example, a character \nwearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot \nof elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either.\nATTUNEMENT\nSome magic items require a creature to form a bond \nwith them before their magical properties can be used. \nThis bond is called attunement, and certain items have a \nprerequisite for attunement. If the prerequisite is a class, \na creature must be a member of that class to attune to the \nitem. If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature \nqualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or \nfeatures, not from using a magic item or the like.\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requires \nattunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, \nunless its description states otherwise. For example, a \nmagic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits \nof a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none \nof its magical properties.\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short \nrest focused on only that item while being in physical \ncontact with it. This focus can take the form of weapon \npractice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), \nor some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is \ninterrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at \nthe end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive \nunderstanding of how to activate any magical properties of \nthe item, including any necessary command words.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 58\nhas remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, \nas well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when \nan item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns \nhow many charges it regained.\nMAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS\nThis section lists some magic items found within the \nknown universe. Each entry provides key information \nabout the item, including its rarity category, whether or not \nit requires attunement to use, its price, and a description of \nits properties.\nAmmunition, +1, +2, or +3\nWeapon (Any Ammunition), Rarity Varies \nPrice Varies\nYou have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with \nthis piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined \nby the rarity of the ammunition. Once it successfully hits \na target, the ammunition becomes a nonmagical piece of \nammunition.\nAMMUNITION\nBONUS RARITY COST\n+1 Uncommon 50 gp (each)\n+2 Rare 100 gp (each)\n+3 Very Rare 350 gp (each)\nArmor, +1, +2, or +3\nArmor (Light, Medium, Heavy), Rarity Varies \nPrice Varies\nWhile wearing this armor, you receive the armor’s \nstandard bonus to AC and an additional AC bonus equal \nto its rarity bonus.\nARMOR\nBONUS RARITY COST\n+1 Rare 1,500 gp + armor base cost\n+2 Very Rare 7,500 gp + armor base cost\n+3 Legendary 25,000 gp + armor base cost\nBag of Devouring\nWondrous Item, Very Rare 15,000 gp\nThis bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a \nfeeding orifice for a gigantic, extradimensional creature. \nTurning the bag inside out temporarily closes the orifice. \nThe extradimensional creature attached to the bag can \nsense whatever is placed inside of it. Animal or vegetable \nmatter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost \nforever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, \nas happens when someone reaches in, there is a 50 percent \nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, \nand a creature can be attuned to no more than a number \nof items equal to its proficiency bonus (PB) at any one \ntime. Any attempt to attune to an additional item fails; \nthe creature must end its attunement to an item first. \nAdditionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy \nof an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more \nthan one ring of protection at a time.\nA creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature \nno longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if \nthe item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 \nhours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to \nthe item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement \nby spending another short rest focused on the item, unless \nthe item is cursed.\nACTIVATING AN ITEM\nActivating some magic items requires a user to do \nsomething special, such as holding the item and uttering \na command word. The description of an item category or \nindividual item details how an item is activated. Certain \nitems use the following rules for their activation.\nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a \nfunction of the Use an Item action.\nCOMMAND WORD\nA command word is a word or phrase that must be \nspoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a \ncommand word can’t be activated in an area where sound is \nprevented, as in the area of the silence spell.\nSPELLS\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the \nitem. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell ring, \ndoesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no \ncomponents, unless the item’s description says otherwise. \nThe spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, \nand the user of the item must concentrate if the spell \nrequires concentration. Many items, such as potions, \nbypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects \nwith their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions \nto these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other \nparts of a spell.\nA magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to \nuse your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from \nthe item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you \nchoose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a \nspellcasting ability, your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 \nfor the item, and your PB does apply.\nCHARGES\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended to \nactivate their properties. The number of charges an item \n59 Chaptier 3: Equipment & Magic Items\nchance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature \ninside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a \nsuccessful DC 15 STR (Athletics) check. Another creature \ncan use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature \nout, doing so with a successful DC 20 STR (Athletics) \ncheck (assuming that creature wasn’t also pulled inside the \nbag). Any creature that that starts its turn inside the bag is \ndevoured, and its body is destroyed.\nThe bag holds up to 1 cubic foot of inanimate, \nnon-organic objects without a fuss. However, once each \nday, the bag swallows these types of objects placed in the \nbag and spits them out into a random plane of existence. \nThe GM determines the time and plane.\nIf the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed. Anything \nwithin it is transported to a random location on a random \nplane determined by the GM.\nBag of Holding\nWondrous Item, Uncommon 1,000 gp\nThis bag has an interior space considerably larger than \nits outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at \nthe mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 \npounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag \nweighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving \nan item from the bag requires an action.\nIf the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and \nis destroyed, and its contents are scattered in another plane \nof existence. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents \nspill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before \nit can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can \nsurvive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by \nthe number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which \ntime they begin to suffocate.\nPlacing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space \ncreated by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item \ninstantly destroys both items and opens a gate to another \nplane. The gate originates where the one item was placed \ninside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate \nis sucked through it to a random location within another \nplane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can’t \nbe reopened.\nBead of Force\nWondrous Item, Rare 650 gp\nThis small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in \ndiameter and weighs 1 ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads of \nforce are found together.\nYou can use an action to throw a bead up to 60 feet. The \nbead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature \nwithin a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must \nsucceed on a DC 15 DEX save or take 5d4 force damage. \nA sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 \nminute. Any creature that fails the save and is completely \nwithin the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that \nsucceed on the save, or are partially within the area, are \npushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no \nlonger inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the \nsphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.\nAn enclosed creature can use its action to push against the \nsphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s \nwalking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic \ncauses it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of \ncreatures inside.\nCrystal Ball\nWondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement) \nPrice Varies\nThe typical crystal ball is a very rare magic item about 6 \ninches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the \nscrying spell (save DC 17) with it.\nThe following crystal ball variants are legendary items and \nhave additional properties.\nCrystal Ball of Mind Reading. You can use an action to \ncast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 17) while you are \nscrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can \nsee within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You don’t need to \nconcentrate to maintain detect thoughts for the duration of \nthe spell, but it ends if scrying ends.\nCrystal Ball of Telepathy. While scrying with the crystal \nball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures \nyou can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You can \nalso use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC \n17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You \ndon’t need to concentrate to maintain suggestion for \nthe duration of the spell, but it ends if scrying ends. The \nsuggestion power of the crystal ball can’t be used again \nuntil the next dawn.\nCrystal Ball of True Seeing. While scrying with the crystal \nball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered \non the spell’s sensor.\nCRYSTAL BALL\nVARIANT RARITY COST\nCrystal Ball Very Rare 30,000 gp \nCrystal Ball of Mind Reading Legendary 52,000 gp\nCrystal Ball of Telepathy Legendary 60,000 gp \nCrystal Ball of True Seeing Legendary 70,000 gp\nImmovable Rod\nRod, Uncommon 1,000 gp\nThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use \nan action to press the button, which causes the rod to \nbecome magically fixed in place. Until you or another \ncreature uses an action to push the button again, the rod \ndoesn’t move, even if it defies gravity. The rod can hold up \nBlack Flag Roleplaying 60\nto 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to \ndeactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make \na DC 30 STR check, moving a fixed rod up to 10 feet on a \nsuccess.\nOil of Slipperiness\nPotion, Uncommon 350 gp\nThis sticky, black unguent is thick and heavy in the \ncontainer, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil \ncan cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the \nequipment it wears and carries (one additional vial is \nrequired for each size category above Medium). Applying \nthe oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains \nthe effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.\nAlternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an \naction, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the \neffect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\nPotion of Healing\nPotion, Rarity Varies Price Varies\nThis red, glimmering potion allows you to regain hit \npoints when you drink it. The number of hit points \ndepends on the potion’s rarity, as shown on the Potions \nof Healing table.\nPOTIONS OF HEALING\nPOTION OF… RARITY\nHP \nREGAINED PRICE\nHealing Common 2d4 + 2 50 gp \nGreater Healing Uncommon 4d4 + 4 100 gp\nSuperior Healing Rare 8d4 + 8 350 gp \nSupreme Healing Very Rare 10d4 + 20 1,500 gp\nSpell Scroll\nScroll, Rarity Varies Price Varies\nA spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a \nmystical cipher. If the spell is on your circle’s spell list, you \ncan read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any \nmaterial components. Otherwise, it is unintelligible.\nCasting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s \nnormal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on \nthe scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is \ninterrupted, the scroll is not lost.\nIf the spell is on your circle’s spell list but of a higher level \nthan you can normally cast, you must make an ability check \nusing your spellcasting ability to determine whether you \ncast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s ring. On \na failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no \nother effect.\nThe spell ring determines the scroll’s rarity, save DC, \nattack bonus, and price, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\nAn arcane circle spell on a spell scroll can be copied \njust as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is \ncopied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an \nINT (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s \nring. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. \nWhether the check succeeds or fails, copying destroys the \nscroll.\nSPELL SCROLL\nSPELL \nRING RARITY\nSAVE \nDC\nATTACK \nBONUS PRICE\nCantrip Common 13 +5 10 gp \n1st Common 13 +5 50 gp\n2nd Uncommon 13 +5 100 gp \n3rd Uncommon 15 +7 200 gp\n4th Rare 15 +7 350 gp\n5th Rare 17 +9 650 gp\n6th Very Rare 17 +9 1,500 gp\n7th Very Rare 18 +10 2,500 gp\n8th Very Rare 18 +10 5,000 gp\n9th Legendary 19 +11 10,500 gp\nWand of Secrets\nWand, Uncommon 500 gp\nThis wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an \naction to expend 1 of its charges. If a secret door or trap \nis within 30 feet of you, the wand pulses and points at the \none nearest you. The wand regains 1d3 expended charges \ndaily at dawn.\nWeapon, +1, +2, or +3\nWeapon (Any), Rarity Varies Price Varies\nYou have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with \nthis magic weapon.

        "CHAPTER 4: SPELLCASTING\nPotent energies permeate the universe. Magic is the \nmanipulation of those energies to change reality. Those \nwho can harness such energies are called spellcasters. \nSpellcasters are categorized into groups based on the \nsource of their power. Regardless of sources, the laws that \nrule these reality-shaping effects, known as spells, are the \nsame. This section outlines the rules of spellcasting and \nincludes a selection of commonly seen spells.\nWhat is a Spell?\nA spell is a manipulation of reality accomplished using \na combination of will and energy. Every spell must have \nenergy to fuel its effects and a spellcaster capable of \ncontrolling the flow of energy. Spells can accomplish any \nnumber of things—harm, protection, problem-solving—\nall guided by a caster’s imagination.\nCreating a new spell is a work of extreme creativity and \nintense effort, often resulting from a lifetime of study. \nBecause of this, most casters choose their spells from \nestablished pools of knowledge.\nCIRCLES OF MAGIC\nCircles of magic represent primary sources that fuel \nspellcaster abilities. This section details two circles of magic, \narcane and divine, and explains their roles in spellcasting. \nARCANE CIRCLE\nThe arcane circle draws its power from manipulating \nmeasurable forces that govern material reality. This \nincludes forces like heat, space, and gravity. An arcane \ncaster uses a precise combination of words, gestures, and \nmaterials to ignite a roaring flame or link two locations \nhundreds of miles apart. \nArcane magic is governed by an extensive set of rules \nand calculations, which a caster uses to enact effects. It \ncan resemble a science more than mystical workings. \nHarnessing magic from this circle requires creativity, \nprecision, and a drive for perfection.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 62\nSPELL RINGS\nEvery spell is categorized into a ring, ranked from 1st to \n9th. Higher rings require more energy to fuel the spell and \nhave stronger effects.\nLike the rings within a tree trunk, rings of magic encircle \none another. A novice spellcaster starts at the center of the \ncircle with access to the 1st ring. As they grow in ability, \ntheir powers expand toward the circle’s edge, giving access \nto more rings. The further a ring is from the center, the \nhigher level a spellcaster must be to use that ring’s spells.\nEach class provides a table of what spellcaster level you \nmust achieve before you gain access to new spell rings. \nTypically, a spellcaster must be at least 17th level before \nthey can cast spells from the 9th and final ring.\nSPELL SLOTS\nSpell slots are a measure of the energy a caster has to \nfuel their spells. Check the progression table for your \nspellcasting class to see how many spell slots your character \nhas at a given level. As you gain levels, you gain new slots to \ncast spells from higher rings and more slots for spells from \nlower rings.\nA caster who has used all their spell slots is spent, \nphysically and mentally. They’re out of energy for spells. \nTo replenish spell slots, you must complete a short or long \nrest—each class specifies which type of rest and how many \nslots you regain. This rest represents the time needed to \nrecover from the toll spellcasting takes on the body and \nmind.\nSCHOOLS OF MAGIC\nPractitioners and sages have attempted to quantify and \ncategorize the complexities of magic into eight universally \nrecognized categories known as spell schools. These \nschools have no inherent influence on a spell, but they help \nidentify a spell’s effect. Specific class features or character \nabilities may refer to these schools. The eight schools are \nbroadly explained in this section.\nABJURATION\nAbjuration spells use wards, shields, and other means of \ndeflection to defend their target. Such spells might look \nlike creating a force shield to block incoming missiles or \nimbuing a homestead with a ward to deter unwanted pests.\nCONJURATION\nConjuration spells restructure space, enabling objects, \ncreatures, and other targets to be transported from place to \nplace. Such spells might look like causing a lost house key \nto appear in your hand or creating a portal that allows for \ninstantaneous travel to a far-flung realm of existence.\nDIVINATION\nDivination spells collect information, allowing a user to \nglean locations, outcomes, or sensory feedback beyond the \nlimitations of standard perception. Such spells might look \nlike sensing the location of a hidden entrance or receiving a \nvision of future events.\nENCHANTMENT\nEnchantment spells influence the minds of creatures, \nallowing a user to manipulate emotions or behavior.\nEVOCATION\nEvocation spells shape energy, allowing a user to channel \nhealing, change air into roaring flame, or stir the skies into \na raging storm.\nILLUSION\nIllusion spells deceive the senses, allowing a user to mask \nor alter the truth and create objects that seem real.\nNECROMANCY\nNecromancy spells manipulate life, allowing a user to use \nanother’s life force to heal or reanimate the dead.\nTRANSMUTATION\nTransmutation spells alter the forms of creatures or \nobjects, allowing a user to turn lead into gold or transform \nan enemy into a toad.\nKNOWN SPELLS\nA spellcaster must be extremely familiar with a spell or \npossess a magic item imbued with the spell to cast it. Each \nspellcasting class solves this familiarity issue differently.\nFor example, a wizard catalogs their known spells in a \nspellbook and adds to it whenever they discover a new spell. \nYour character class defines how many spells you know and \ncan potentially learn as you gain more class levels.\nPREPARED SPELLS\nA prepared spell is ready to cast quickly, in the heat of \nbattle, without extensive reading or setup. Due to the \nintense mental fortitude necessary, the number of spells a \ncaster can prepare at one time is generally limited.\nSome spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, must \nprepare all their spells ahead of time through study or \nmeditation. Different spellcasting classes with shorter \nknown spell lists can automatically prepare all their known \nspells.\nYour character class defines what you must do to prepare \nspells and how many spells you can have prepared at any \ngiven level.\n63 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting\nBONUS ACTION\nA spell cast with a bonus action is fast. You must use a \nbonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided you \nhaven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. If you use \nyour bonus action to cast a spell from the 1st ring or higher \non your turn, you can’t also use your action to cast a spell \nfrom the 1st ring or higher during the same turn.\nREACTION\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take \na fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in \nresponse to specific triggering events. If a spell can be cast \nas a reaction, the spell description specifies the trigger \nrequired. \nLONGER CASTING TIMES\nCertain spells (particularly rituals) require more time to \ncast, minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with \na casting time longer than a single action or reaction, \nyou must spend your action each turn casting, and \nyou must maintain concentration while you do so (see \nConcentration). If your concentration is broken, the spell \nfails, but the attempt doesn’t use a spell slot. To try casting \nthe spell again, you must start over.\nRANGE\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For \na spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell \nlike fireball, the target is a point in space where the ball of \nfire erupts.\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can \ntarget only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other \nspells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells \nhave a range of self.\nSpells that appear in cones or lines that originate from \nyou also have a range of self, indicating that the origin \npoint must be you (see Area of Effect).\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range \nunless the spell’s description says otherwise.\nAREA OF EFFECT\nSpells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, \nallowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\nA spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which \ntypically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, \ncylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of \norigin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The \nrules for each shape specify how you position its origin. \nUsually, the origin is a point in space that you choose \nwithin the spell’s range, but some spells originate from a \ncreature or an object.\nCANTRIPS\nSome spellcasters can employ a simple type of spell called \na cantrip. A cantrip can be cast without using a spell slot \nand without being prepared. Repeated practice has fixed \nthe spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the \nenergy needed to produce the effect on demand. A cantrip’s \nspell ring is 0.\nYour class defines whether you can access cantrips, and \nhow many cantrips you know at each class level.\nRITUALS\nRitual spells are uniquely powerful magic that takes 1 \nminute or longer to cast and often requires costly material \ncomponents. A caster can only learn ritual spells associated \nwith their circle of magic.\nRitual spells don’t use spell slots. Otherwise, ritual spells \nfollow normal spellcasting rules.\nYour character class defines whether you can access ritual \nspells, and how many rituals you know at each class level.\nCASTING IN ARMOR\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required \nfor spellcasting, you must be proficient with any armor you \nare wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted \nand hampered for spellcasting.\nCOMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS\nThe effects of different spells combine while the durations \nof those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast \nmultiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most \npotent effect, such as the highest bonus from multiple \ncastings, applies while their durations overlap.\nFor example, if two wizards cast mage armor on the same \ntarget, that target gains the spell’s benefit only once; they \ndon’t get multiple AC bonuses.\nElements of A Spell\nWhen a character casts a spell, the basic rules are the same \nregardless of the spell ring or its circle.\nEach spell in this chapter includes basic information, \nincluding the spell’s name, ring, circle, school, casting \ntime, range, required components, and duration. Every \nspell also contains a description of its effect.\nCASTING TIME\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some can be \naccomplished in a shorter or longer span.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 64\nA spell’s effect expands in straight lines from its origin. \nIf no unblocked straight line extends from the origin \nto a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t \nincluded in the spell’s area. To block one of these straight \nlines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\nCONE\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of \norigin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is \nequal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A \ncone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.\nA cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area \nof effect unless you decide otherwise.\nCUBE\nYou select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on \na face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the \nlength of each side.\nA cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area \nof effect unless you decide otherwise.\nCYLINDER\nA cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a \nparticular radius, as given in the spell description. The \ncircle must either be on the ground or at the height of the \nspell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight \nlines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, \nforming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then \nshoots up from the base or down from the top to a distance \nequal to the height of the cylinder.\nA cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s \narea of effect.\nLINE\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up \nto its length and covers an area defined by its width.\nA line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of \neffect unless you decide otherwise.\nSPHERE\nYou select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends \noutward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a \nradius in feet that extends from the point.\nA sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area \nof effect.\nCOMPONENTS\nA spell’s components are the physical requirements you \nmust meet to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates \nwhether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) \ncomponents. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s \ncomponents, you can’t cast the spell.\nVERBAL (V)\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The \ncombination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, \nsets the magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged \nor in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence \nspell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\nSOMATIC (S)\nSpellcasting might include a forceful gesticulation or \nan intricate set of motions. If a spell requires a somatic \ncomponent, the caster must have free use of at least one \nhand to perform these gestures.\nMATERIAL (M)\nCasting some spells requires specific objects detailed \nin parentheses in the component entry. A character can \nuse a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in \nEquipment) in place of the components specified for a \nspell. However, if a cost is indicated for a component, a \npouch or focus can’t substitute for it. The character must \nhave that specific component to cast the spell.\nIf a spell states that a material component is consumed by \nthe spell, the caster must provide this component for each \ncasting of the spell.\nA spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s \nmaterial components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—\nbut it can be the same hand that they use to perform \nsomatic components.\nDURATION\nA spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. \nA duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, or even \nyears. Some spells specify that their effects last until the \nspells are dispelled or destroyed.\nINSTANTANEOUS\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, \ncreates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t \nbe dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\nCONCENTRATION\nSome spells require concentration to keep the magic active. \nIf you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact \nappears in its duration entry, and it specifies how long you \ncan concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any \ntime (no action required).\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t \ninterfere with concentration. The following factors can \nbreak concentration:\n• Casting another spell that requires concentration.\nYou lose concentration on a spell if you cast another \nspell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate \non two spells at once.\n65 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting\n• Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you \nare concentrating on a spell, you must make a CON \nsave to maintain your concentration. The DC of this \nsave equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever \nnumber is higher. If you take damage from multiple \nsources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you \nmake a separate save for each source of damage.\n• Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration \non a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmental \nphenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re \non a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a CON \nsave to maintain concentration on a spell.\nDESCRIPTION\nEach spell includes a description of its effects, including \nkey information about how the spell works.\nTARGETS\nA typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to \nbe affected by the spell’s magic. A spell tells you whether \nthe spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for \nan area of effect (described in the Area of Effect section).\nUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might \nnot know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like \ncrackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, \nsuch as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically \ngoes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\nA CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGET\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it \ncan’t be behind total cover.\nIf you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see \nand an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and the \npoint, the point of origin comes into being on the near side \nof that obstruction.\nTARGETING YOURSELF\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose \nyourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically \na creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a \nspell you cast, you can target yourself.\nSPELL SAVES\nMany spells specify that a target can make a save to avoid \nsome or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability \nthe target uses for the save and what happens on a success \nor failure.\nThe DC to resist a spell equals 8 + the caster's spellcasting \nability modifier + the caster's PB + any special modifiers.\nSPELL ATTACK ROLLS\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll to \ndetermine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. \nA caster's attack bonus with a spell attack equals their \nspellcasting ability modifier + their PB.\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged \nattacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged \nattack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that \ncan see you and that isn’t incapacitated.\nSpell Lists\nThis section lists the spells available to casters of the various circles of magic. The list is organized by circle, then by spell ring. \nEach spell also belongs to a school of magic, which is identified in parentheses after the spell’s name.\nARCANE CIRCLE SPELL LIST\nThese spells

Make a ranged spell \nattack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid \ndamage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of \nits next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with \nacid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage \nat the end of its next turn.\nACID SPLASH\nArcane Cantrip (Conjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou conjure a glob of acid to burst over your targets.\nChoose one creature within range, or choose two creatures \nwithin range that are within 5 feet of each other.

Choose any number \nof creatures within range. For the duration, each target has \nadvantage on WIS saves and death saves, and regains the \nmaximum number of hit points possible from any healing.\nBESTOW CURSE\n3rd-Ring Divine (Necromancy)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nWith a simple touch, you inflict a creature with a weakness of \nyour choosing. \nYou touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a \nWIS save or become cursed for the duration of the spell. \nWhen you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse \nfrom the following options:\n• Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has \ndisadvantage on ability checks and saves made with that \nability score.\n• While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack \nrolls against you.\n• While cursed, the target must make a WIS save at the \nstart of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action \nthat turn doing nothing.\n• While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal \nan extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 68\nA remove curse spell ends this effect. At the GM’s option, \nyou may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be \nno more powerful than those described above. The GM has \nfinal say on such a curse’s effect.\nBLESS\n1st-Ring Divine (Enchantment)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou bless a group of creatures with affirmation and good fortune.\nYou bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. \nWhenever a target makes an attack roll or a save before \nthe spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number \nrolled to the attack roll or save.\nBLINK\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou fade in and out, jumping rapidly between your current plane \nand the Ethereal.\nRoll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration \nof the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your \ncurrent plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane \n(the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already \non that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the \nspell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an \nunoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 \nfeet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space \nis available within that range, you appear in the nearest \nunoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space \nis equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.\nWhile on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the \nplane you began in, which is cast in shades of gray, and \nyou can’t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You \ncan only affect and be affected by other creatures on the \nEthereal Plane.\nCreatures that aren’t there can’t perceive you or interact \nwith you, unless they have the ability to do so.\nBLINDNESS/DEAFNESS\n2nd-Ring Arcane and Divine (Necromancy)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 minute\nYour words strike your target’s senses, temporarily disabling their \nsight or hearing.\nYou can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that \nyou can see within range to make a CON save. If it fails, \nthe target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for \nthe duration.

On a success, the spell ends.\nBLUR\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou take on a blurred, shifting appearance that is difficult for \nothers to clearly discern.\nYour body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to \nall who can see you. For the duration, any creature has \ndisadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is \nimmune to this effect if it doesn’t rely on sight, as with \nkeensense, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.\nBURNING HANDS\n1st-Ring Arcane (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou release a gout of fire from your hands, blazing the area with \narcane flames.\nAs you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers \nspread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your \noutstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone \nmust make a DEX save. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on \na failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that \naren’t being worn or carried.\nCALM EMOTIONS\n2nd-Ring Divine (Enchantment)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nWith supernatural charm, you quell the riled emotions of a group \nof people.\nYou attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group \nof people. Each Humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere \ncentered on a point you choose within range must make \na CHA save; a creature can choose to fail this save if \n69 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting\nit wishes. If a creature fails its save, choose one of the \nfollowing two effects.\n• Suppression. You can suppress any effect causing a \ntarget to be charmed or frightened. When this spell \nends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its \nduration has not expired in the meantime.\n• Indifference. Alternatively, you can make a target \nindifferent about creatures of your choice that it is \nhostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is \nattacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its \nfriends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature \nbecomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.\nCHARM PERSON\n1st-Ring Arcane (Enchantment)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYour entrancing words and motions gain your target’s confidence \nand friendship.\nYou attempt to charm a Humanoid you can see within \nrange. It must make a WIS save, and does so with \nadvantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If \nit fails the save, it is charmed by you until the spell ends \nor until you or your companions do anything harmful \nto it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly \nacquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it \nwas charmed by you.\nCOLOR SPRAY\n1st-Ring Arcane (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is \ncolored red, yellow, and blue)\nDuration: 1 round\nYou shower nearby foes with blinding colors and flashing lights.\nA dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from \nyour hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of \ncreatures this spell can affect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone \noriginating from you are affected in ascending order of \ntheir current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures \nand creatures that can’t see).\nStarting with the creature that has the lowest current hit \npoints, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until \nthe spell ends. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the \ntotal before moving on to the creature with the next lowest \nhit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less \nthan the remaining total for that creature to be affected.\nCOMMAND\n1st-Ring Divine (Enchantment)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou empower your spoken word with divine authority that few \ncan resist.\nYou speak a one-word command to a creature you can \nsee within range. The target must succeed on a WIS save \nor follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no \neffect if the target is Undead, if it doesn’t understand your \nlanguage, or if your command is directly harmful to it.\nSome typical commands and their effects follow. You \nmight issue a command other than one described here. If \nyou do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If \nthe target can’t follow your command, the spell ends.\nApproach. The target moves toward you by the shortest \nand most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 \nfeet of you.\nDrop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then \nends its turn.\nFlee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by \nthe fastest available means.\nGrovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.\nHalt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A \nflying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. \nIf it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance \nneeded to remain in the air.\nCOMPREHEND LANGUAGES\n1st-Ring Arcane (Divination)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou understand any language you hear or read.\nFor the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any \nspoken language that you hear. You also understand any \nwritten language that you see, but you must be touching \nthe surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 \nminute to read one page of text.\nThis spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or a \nglyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written \nlanguage.\nCONTINUAL FLAME\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the \nBlack Flag Roleplaying 70\nspell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou create an unending flame, producing all the light of a torch \nwithout combustion. \nA flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs from \nan object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular \nflame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. \nA continual flame can be covered or hidden but not \nsmothered or quenched.\nCOUNTERSPELL\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Abjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a \ncreature within 60 feet of you casting a spell\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou quickly call forth antithetical elements to negate another \ncaster’s magic.\nYou attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of \ncasting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd ring or \nlower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell \nof 4th ring or beyond, make an ability check using your \nspellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s ring. On \na success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.\nCREATE FOOD AND WATER\n3rd-Ring Divine (Conjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou conjure sustenance and water to feed a small band of \nadventurers or their horses, but not both. \nYou create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the \nground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up \nto fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is \nbland but nourishing but spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. \nThe water is clean and doesn’t go bad.\nCURE WOUNDS\n1st-Ring Divine (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a wounded creature and heal them.\nA creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal \nto 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\nThis spell has no effect on Undead or Constructs.\nDANCING LIGHTS\nArcane Cantrip (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, \nor a glowworm)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a quartet of magical lights under your control.\nYou create up to four torch-sized lights within range, \nmaking them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs \nthat hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine \nthe four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of \nMedium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds \ndim light in a 10-foot radius.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights \nup to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be \nwithin 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a \nlight winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.\nDARKNESS\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (bat fur and pitch or piece of coal)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou conjure a globe of darkness that makes it impossible to see \nanything inside of it.\nMagical darkness spreads from a point you choose within \nrange to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. \nThe darkness spreads around corners. A creature with \ndarkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical \nlight won't illuminate it.\nIf the point you choose is on an object you are holding or \none that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates \nfrom the object and moves with it. Completely covering \nthe source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a \nbowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.\nIf any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light \ncreated by a 2nd ring spell or lower, the spell that created \nthe light is dispelled.\nDARKVISION\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou enable your target to see in the dark.\nYou touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in \nthe dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out \n71 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting\nto a range of 60 feet.\nDAYLIGHT\n3rd-Ring Divine (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou conjure light as bright as day, which banishes darkness.\nA 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point \nyou choose within range. The sphere is bright light and \nsheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\nIf you choose a point on an object you are holding or one \nthat isn’t being worn or carried, the light shines from the \nobject and moves with it. Completely covering the affected \nobject with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, \nblocks the light.\nIf any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness \ncreated by a spell of 3rd ring or lower, the spell that created \nthe darkness is dispelled.\nDETECT MAGIC\n1st-Ring Arcane (Divination)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou sense the presence of nearby magic.\nFor the duration, you sense the presence of magic within \n30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use \nyour action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or \nobject in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school \nof magic, if any.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 \nfoot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, \nor 3 feet of wood or dirt.\nDETECT EVIL AND GOOD\n1st-Ring Divine (Divination)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou sense nearby creatures and locations who align to extreme \nnotions of morality and transience.\nFor the duration, you know if there is an Aberration, \nCelestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead within 30 feet \nof you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, \nyou know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you \nthat has been magically consecrated or desecrated.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 \nfoot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, \nor 3 feet of wood or dirt.\nDETECT THOUGHTS\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Divination)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a copper piece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou reach out with your intellect, sensing the minds of others and \ntheir thoughts. \nFor the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain \ncreatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on \neach turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on \nany one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If \nthe creature you choose has an INT modifier of -4 or lower \nor doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.\nYou initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—\nwhat is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, \nyou can either shift your attention to another creature’s \nthoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same \ncreature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make \na WIS save. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if \nany), its emotional state, and something that looms large in \nits mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). \nIf it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows \nthat you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift \nyour attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature \ncan use its action on its turn to make an INT check \ncontested by your INT check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally \nshape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly \neffective as part of an interrogation.\nYou can also use this spell to detect the presence of \nthinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell \nor as your action during the duration, you can search for \nthoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate \nbarriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than \nlead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect \na creature with an INT modifier of −4 or less or one that \ndoesn’t speak any language.\nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, \nyou can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as \ndescribed above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be \nwithin range.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 72\nDISGUISE SELF\n1st-Ring Arcane (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou wear an illusion that makes your appearance seem different.\nYou make yourself—including your clothing, armor, \nweapons, and other belongings on your person— look \ndifferent until the spell ends or until you use your action \nto dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can \nappear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body \ntype, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic \narrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion \nis up to you.\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to \nphysical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to \nadd a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and \nanyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel \nyour head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner \nthan you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to \ntouch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still \nin midair.\nTo discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its \naction to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an \nINT (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\nDISPEL MAGIC\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Abjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou break a spell’s power, ending its effects.\nChoose one creature, object, or magical effect within \nrange. Any spell of 3rd ring or lower on the target ends. \nFor each spell of 4th ring or higher on the target, make an \nability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals \n10 + the spell’s ring. On a successful check, the spell ends.\nELEMENTAL BLADE\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a leaf of sumac)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA blade of elemental energy appears in your hand.\nYou evoke an elemental blade in your free hand. The blade \nis similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for \nthe duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but \nyou can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. When the \nblade appears, you decide whether it deals acid, cold, fire, \nlightning, or thunder damage.\nYou can use your action to make a melee spell attack with \nthe elemental blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 damage \nof the chosen type. The elemental blade sheds bright light \nin a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\nENLARGE/REDUCE\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou change one target’s size, dramatically shrinking or expanding \nits shape.\nYou cause a creature or an object you can see within range to \ngrow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose a creature \nor an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target \nis unwilling, it can make a CON save. On a success, the \nspell has no effect. If the target is a creature, everything \nit is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item \ndropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at \nonce.\nEnlarge. The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and \nits weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases \nits size by one category— from Medium to Large, for \nexample. If there isn’t enough room for the target to \ndouble its size, the creature or object attains the maximum \npossible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the \ntarget also has advantage on STR checks and STR saves. \nThe target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. \nWhile these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with \nthem deal 1d4 extra damage.\nReduce. The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, \nand its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This \nreduction decreases its size by one category—from \nMedium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the \ntarget also has disadvantage on STR checks and STR saves. \nThe target’s weapons also shrink to match its new size. \nWhile these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with \nthem deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage \nbelow 1).\nEXPEDITIOUS RETREAT\n1st-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes.\nYou gain the ability to move at an incredible pace.\n73 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting\nWhen you cast this spell, and then as a bonus action on \neach of your turns until the spell ends, you can take the \nDash action.\nFALSE LIFE\n1st-Ring Arcane (Necromancy)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a small amount of alcohol or \ndistilled spirits)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou imbue yourself with a wellspring of vitality.\nBolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, \nyou gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.\nFEAR\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (30-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou give form to your target’s worst fears. Then you show it to them.\nYou project a phantasmal image of a creature’s worst fears. \nEach creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a WIS \nsave or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened \nfor the duration.\nWhile frightened by this spell, a creature must take \nthe Dash action and move away from you by the safest \navailable route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere \nto move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where \nit doesn’t have line of sight to you, the creature can make \na WIS save. On a successful save, the spell ends for that \ncreature.\nFEATHER FALL\n1st-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you or a \ncreature within 60 feet of you falls\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, M (a small feather or piece of down)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou quickly turn a hard fall into a gentle descent.\nChoose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling \ncreature’s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until \nthe spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, \nit takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the \nspell ends for that creature.\nFIND TRAPS\n2nd-Ring Divine (Divination)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou gain insight into nearby traps, learning their locations and \nrelative danger.\nYou sense the presence of any trap within range that \nis within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this \nspell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or \nunexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, \nwhich was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, \nthe spell would sense an area affected by the alarm or glyph \nof warding spells, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not \nreveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, \nor a hidden sinkhole.\nThis spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t \nlearn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general \nnature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.\nFIREBALL\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou hurl a small ball of flame that explodes in a huge conflagration.\nA bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point \nyou choose within range and then blossoms with a low \nroar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot\u0002radius sphere centered on that point must make a DEX \nsave. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half \nas much damage on a successful one.\nThe fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable \nobjects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.\nFIRE BOLT\nArcane Cantrip (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou send a bolt of fire blazing toward your target.\nYou hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. \nMake a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the \ntarget takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by \nthis spell ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried.\nThis spell’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th \nlevel (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 74\nFIRE UNDER THE TONGUE\n1st-Ring Arcane (Transmutation) \nCasting Time: 1 action \nRange: 5 feet \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 24 hours \nYou consume fire and hold it until you spit out the flames. \nYou can ingest a nonmagical fire up to the size of a Small \ncampfire within range. The fire is stored harmlessly in your \nmouth and dissipates without effect if it is not expelled \nbefore the spell ends.\nOnce ingested, you can spit out the stored fire as an \naction. If you try to hit a particular target with the flames, \ntreat this as a ranged attack with a range of 5 feet. Small \ncampfire-sized flames deal 2d6 fire damage, while Tiny \ntorch-sized flames deal 1d6 fire damage. Once you have spit \nout the flames, the fire goes out immediately unless it hits \nflammable material that can keep it fed.\nFLAMING SPHERE\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Conjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, \nand a dusting of powdered iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou conjure a roiling ball of flame that acts on your command.\nA 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied \nspace of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. \nAny creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere \nmust make a DEX save. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage \non a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAs a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. \nIf you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must \nmake the save against the sphere’s damage, and the sphere \nstops moving this turn.\nWhen you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers \nup to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. \nThe sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or \ncarried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and \ndim light for an additional 20 feet.\nFLOATING DISK\n1st-Ring Arcane (Conjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou conjure a floating platform to carry things for you.\nThis spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet \nin diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the \nground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can \nsee within range. The disk remains for the duration and can \nhold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the \nspell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.\nThe disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of \nit. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk \nfollows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can \nmove across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes, \nand the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 \nfeet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across \na 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was \ncreated at the bottom.\nIf you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically \nbecause it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the \nspell ends.\nFLY\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nWith an arcane phrase and a touch, you grant the power of flight.\nYou touch a willing creature.

The target can enter and occupy \nthe space of another creature. The target has resistance to \nnonmagical damage, and it has advantage on STR, DEX, \nand CON saves. The target can pass through small holes, \nnarrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats \nliquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t \nfall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or \notherwise incapacitated.\nWhile in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk \nor manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or \nholding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted \nwith. The target can’t attack or cast spells.\nGEAR BARRAGE\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Conjuration) \nCasting Time: 1 action \nRange: Self (60-foot cone) \nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of gears worth 5 gp) \nDuration: Instantaneous \nYou hurl a cone of sharp, whirling gears. \nYou conjure a burst of magically propelled gears.

For the duration, the \ntarget is protected from decay and can’t become Undead. \nThe spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising \nthe target from the dead, since days spent under the \ninfluence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of \nspells such as raise dead.\nGRAVE TOUCH\nArcane Cantrip (Necromancy)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nYou create a death grip to assail your target’s life force.\nYou create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature \nwithin range. Make a ranged spell attack against the \ncreature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the \ntarget takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can’t regain hit \npoints until the start of your next turn.

The spell then ends.\nGUIDING BOLT\n1st-Ring Divine (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nA radiant energy bolt flies to your target. The next attack against \nthem could hardly miss.\nA flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice \nwithin range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. \nBlack Flag Roleplaying 76\nOn a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next \nattack roll made against this target before the end of your \nnext turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light \nglittering on the target until then.\nGUST OF WIND\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot line)\nComponents: V, S, M (a legume seed)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou bring forth a continuous blast of wind that blows back nigh \neverything in your path.\nA line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts \nfrom you in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. \nEach creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed \non a STR save or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a \ndirection following the line.\nAny creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement \nfor every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.\nThe gust disperses gas or vapor, and extinguishes candles, \ntorches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It \ncauses protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance \nwildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell \nends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts \nfrom you.\nHASTE\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou imbue your target with swiftness, making them hard to hit \nand faster to hit back.\nChoose a willing creature that you can see within range. \nUntil the spell ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a \n+2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on DEX saves, and it gains \nan additional action on each of its turns. That action can \nbe used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), \nDash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.\nWhen the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions \nuntil after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.\nHEALING WORD\n1st-Ring Divine (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou say a quick prayer that knits small wounds on a nearby target.\nA creature of your choice that you can see within range \nregains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability \nmodifier.

The object \ncan be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, \nor another object that contains a mundane or magical \nmeans that prevents access. A target that is held shut by a \nmundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, \nunstuck, or unbarred. \nIf the object has multiple locks, only one of them is \nunlocked. If you choose a target that is held shut with \narcane lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during \nwhich time the target can be opened and shut normally. \nWhen you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far \naway as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.\nLESSER RESTORATION\n2nd-Ring Divine (Abjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYour blessed touch cures a variety of lesser ailments and conditions \nsuffered by a singular creature.\nYou touch a creature and can end either one disease or \none condition afflicting it.

The image appears at a spot that you can see within \nrange and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, \nincluding sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to \nthe thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold \nto cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder \ndamage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a \ncreature (like a troglodyte’s stench).\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use \nyour action to cause the image to move to any other spot \nwithin range. As the image changes location, you can alter \nits appearance so that its movements appear natural for the \nimage. For example, if you create an image of a creature \nand move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to \nbe walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make \ndifferent sounds at different times, even making it carry on \na conversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an \nillusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that \nuses its action to examine the image can determine that it \nis an illusion with a successful INT (Investigation) check \nagainst your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion \nfor what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its \nother sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\nMASS HEALING WORD\n3rd-Ring Divine (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou utter a compassionate word of power that swiftly heals the \nnearby wounded.\nAs you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of \nyour choice that you can see within range regain hit points \nequal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As long as the \nbreak or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you \nmend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.\nThis spell can physically repair a magic item or Construct, \nbut the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.\nMESSAGE\nArcane Cantrip (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)\nDuration: 1 round\nYou open a clandestine, two-way communication with your \ntarget, known only to you two.\nYou point your finger toward a creature within range and \nwhisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears \nthe message and can reply in a whisper that only you can \nhear.\nYou can cast this spell through solid objects if you are \nfamiliar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. \nMagical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, \na thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The \nspell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel \nfreely around corners or through openings.\nMINOR ILLUSION\nArcane Cantrip (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: 1 minute\nA gesture manifests an illusion of a sound or image of your design.\nYou create a sound or an image of an object within range \nBlack Flag Roleplaying 80\nthat lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you \ndismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper \nto a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a \nlion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you \nchoose. The sound continues unabated throughout the \nduration, or you can make discrete sounds at different \ntimes before the spell ends.\nIf you create an image of an object—such as a chair, \nmuddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger \nthan a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, \nsmell, or any other sensory effect.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an \nillusion, because things can pass through it.\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or \nimage, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with \na successful INT (Investigation) check against your spell \nsave DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the \nillusion becomes faint to the creature.\nMIRROR IMAGE\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou conjure three images of yourself that constantly shift to obscure \nyour true position.\nThree illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. \nUntil the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and \nmimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible \nto track which image is real. You can use your action to \ndismiss the illusory duplicates.\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the \nspell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack \ninstead targets one of your duplicates.\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or \nhigher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With \ntwo duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one \nduplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\nA duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your DEX modifier. If \nan attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A \nduplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that targets it. \nA duplicate ignores all other damage and effects. The spell \nends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it \nrelies on senses other than sight, such as keensense, or if it \ncan perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.\nMISTY STEP\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Conjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWith a quick arcane phrase, you teleport a short way away.\nBriefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 \nfeet to an unoccupied space that you can see.\nNONDETECTION\n3rd-Ring Arcane (Abjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 \ngp sprinkled over the target, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYour target appears unchanged, but your scrying mirror shows no \nsign of them.\nFor the duration, you hide a target that you touch from \ndivination magic.

This spell doesn’t return \nthe creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. \nThus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t \ncomprehend anything that has happened since it died, and \ncan’t speculate about future events.\nSPIDER CLIMB\n2nd-Ring Arcane (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou grant the ability to walk up walls, ceilings, and vertical \nobjects.\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains \nthe ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces \nand upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands \nfree.

Asking the creature to stab itself, \nthrow itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other \nobviously harmful act ends the spell.\nThe target must make a WIS save. On a failed save, it \npursues the course of action you described to the best of its \nability. The suggested course of action can continue for the \nentire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed \nin a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes \nwhat it was asked to do.\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special \nactivity during the duration. For example, you might \nsuggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar \nshe meets.

Choose a \ndoor, a window, or an area within range that is no larger \nthan a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts \nyou whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters \nthe warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate \ncreatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose \nwhether the alarm is mental or audible.\nA mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you \nare within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you \nif you are sleeping.\nAn audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 \nseconds within 60 feet.\nIf you perform this ritual a second time before the \nduration of the first alarm spell has ended, the first alarm \nimmediately ends.\nANIMATE DEAD\n3rd-Ring Arcane and Divine Ritual (Necromancy)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, a \npinch of bone dust, and a bloodstone worth at least 10 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou give the remains of the dead new unlife, crafting a servant out \nof bones, flesh, and your will.\nThis spell creates an Undead servant. Choose a pile of \nbones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within \nrange. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of \nlife, raising it as an Undead creature. The target becomes \na skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a \ncorpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).\nOn each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to \nmentally command any creature you made with this spell if \nthe creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple \ncreatures, you can command any or all of them at the same \ntime, issuing the same command to each one). You decide \nwhat action the creature will take and where it will move \nduring its next turn, or you can issue a general command, \nsuch as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.\nIf you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself \nagainst hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature \ncontinues to follow it until its task is complete.\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after \nwhich it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To \nmaintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you \nmust cast this spell on the creature again before the current \n24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your \ncontrol over up to four creatures you have animated with \nthis spell, rather than animating a new one.\nIf you attempt to cast this spell again while servants \ncreated by the first casting are still active, the servants \ncreated from the first casting are immediately destroyed.\nAs you unlock higher rings, this ritual grows in potency. \nOnce you have access to 4th ring spell slots or higher, you \nanimate or reassert control over two additional Undead \ncreatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures \nmust come from a different corpse or pile of bones.\nARCANE LOCK\n2nd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Abjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, \nwhich the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou lock a targeted object, making it difficult to bypass.\nYou touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other \nentryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You \nand the creatures you designate when you cast this spell \ncan open the object normally. You can also set a password \nthat, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses \nthis spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it \nis broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting \nknock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.\nWhile affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to \nbreak or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on \nit increases by 10.\nARCANIST’S MAGIC AURA\n2nd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a small square of silk and burning \nincense worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou drape your target in an illusory aura, masking its true nature \nbeneath layers of misleading magic.\n89 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting\nYou place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch \nso that divination spells reveal false information about it. \nThe target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t \nbeing carried or worn by another creature.\nWhen you cast the spell, choose one or both of the \nfollowing effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you \ncast this spell on the same creature or object every day for \n30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion \nlasts until it is dispelled.\nFalse Aura. You change the way the target appears to \nspells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect \nmagical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear \nmagical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change \nthe object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a \nspecific school of magic that you choose. When you use this \neffect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent \nto any creature that handles the item.\nMask. You change the way the target appears to spells and \nmagical effects that detect creature types. You choose a \ncreature type and other spells and magical effects treat the \ntarget as if it were a creature of that type.\nAUGURY\n2nd-Ring Divine Ritual (Divination)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or \nsimilar tokens worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou attempt to discern the outcome of your own plans.\nBy casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying \nout ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, \nyou receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about \nthe results of a specific course of action that you plan to \ntake within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the \nfollowing possible omens:\nWeal, for good results\nWoe, for bad results\nWeal and woe, for both good and bad results\nNothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad\nThe spell doesn’t take into account any possible \ncircumstances that might change the outcome, such as \nthe casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a \ncompanion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before completing \nyour next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent \nchance for each casting after the first that you get a random \nreading. The GM makes this roll in secret.\nCLAIRVOYANCE\n3rd-Ring Arcane and Divine Ritual (Divination)\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 1 mile\nComponents: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either \na jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou conjure a small sphere through which you can spy and sense \nnearby locations. \nYou create an invisible sensor within range in a location \nfamiliar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or \nin an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as \nbehind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The \nsensor remains in place for the duration, and it can’t be \nattacked or otherwise interacted with.\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. \nYou can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you \nwere in its space. As your action, you can switch between \nseeing and hearing.\nA creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature \nbenefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, \nintangible orb about the size of your fist.\nCREATE FAMILIAR\n1st-Ring Arcane Ritual (Transmutation)\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 5 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (A life-sized statue, puppet, stuffed \nanimal, or other suitable vessel worth at least 10 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou construct a facsimile of a helpful animal pet to act as your aide \nand companion. \nAs part of this ritual, you imbue your chosen vessel with a \nspark of your own life force to create an arcane familiar. \nThis familiar assumes an animal form you choose from the \nfollowing options: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, \noctopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, \nsea horse, spider, or weasel (see SRD for stat blocks). \nUpon completion of the ritual, your familiar appears in \nan unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The familiar has \nthe statistics of the chosen form, though it is considered \na Construct rather than a Beast for any relevant spells or \neffects.\nBound in Blood. When your familiar first appears, your \nhit point maximum decreases by one. If you permanently \ndismiss your familiar or it is otherwise permanently \ndestroyed, you hit point maximum returns to normal. \nThis reduction can’t be offset by any means as long as your \nfamiliar lives.\nCommunicating with Your Familiar. While your familiar \nis on the same plane or realm of existence as you, it can \nmagically convey what it sees or senses to you, and you can \nBlack Flag Roleplaying 90\ncommunicate with it telepathically.\nControlling Your Familiar. Your familiar acts \nindependently of you, but it always obeys your commands. \nIn combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own \nturn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as \nnormal.\nWhen you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar \ncan deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar \nmust be within 100 feet of you to do so, and it must use its \nreaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell \nrequires an attack roll, you use your spell attack modifier \nfor the roll.\nAs an action, you can touch your familiar to reincorporate \nit into your body. When you do so, it melds into your skin, \nwhere it awaits your summons. While it is incorporated, \nyou can use an action to expel it from your body, causing it \nto appear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.\nDestroying Your Familiar. If a familiar drops to 0 hit \npoints, its body is instantly destroyed. If you still live, your \nfamiliar regrows a new body in 1 hour, regaining all its hit \npoints and becoming active again. The new body appears \nin an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you die, your \nfamiliar is permanently destroyed, and the ritual must be \nperformed again to create a new familiar. At any time, you \ncan use an action to permanently dismiss your familiar, \nwhich instantly destroys it. \nYou can have only one arcane familiar at a time. If you \nattempt to cast this spell while your current familiar still \nlives, the ritual fails.\nDETECT POISON AND DISEASE\n1st-Ring Divine Ritual (Divination)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a yew leaf)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou sense nearby toxic creatures and substances.\nFor the duration, you can sense the presence and location \nof poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 \nfeet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous \ncreature, or disease in each case.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 \nfoot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, \nor 3 feet of wood or dirt.\nGLYPH OF WARDING\n3rd-Ring Arcane and Divine Ritual (Abjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond \nworth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\nYou ward a small area with a near-invisible mark.\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms \nother creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table \nor a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can \nbe closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) \nto conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph \ncan cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in \ndiameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain \nin its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from \nwhere you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell \nends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful \nINT (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be \nfound.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. \nFor glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers \ninclude touching or standing on the glyph, removing \nanother object covering the glyph, approaching within a \ncertain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on \nwhich the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within \nan object, the most common triggers include opening that \nobject, approaching within a certain distance of the object, \nor seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, \nthis spell ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates \nonly under certain circumstances or according to physical \ncharacteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind \n(for example, the ward could be set to affect Aberrations \nor drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for \ncreatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say \na certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a \nspell glyph.\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with \nmagical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the \nglyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in \nthe area must make a DEX save. A creature takes 5d8 acid, \ncold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed save \n(your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much \ndamage on a successful one.\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd ring or \nlower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. \nThe spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell \nbeing stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. \nWhen the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the \nspell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the \nglyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on \nthat creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or \ncreates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as \npossible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires \nconcentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\nIDENTIFY\n1st-Ring Arcane Ritual (Divination)\n91 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an \nowl feather)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou divine an object’s purpose and properties and what magic is \naffecting it.\nYou choose one object that you must touch throughout \nthe casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other \nmagic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to \nuse them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how \nmany charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are \naffecting the item and what they are. If the item was created \nby a spell, you learn which spell created it.\nIf you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, \nyou learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.\nILLUSORY SCRIPT\n1st-Ring Arcane Ritual (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 \ngp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 10 days\nYou scribe an illusion of false, hidden, or indiscernible script that \nlasts for a tenday.\nYou write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable \nwriting material and imbue it with a potent illusion that \nlasts for the duration.\nTo you and any creatures you designate when you cast the \nspell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, \nand conveys whatever meaning you intended when you \nwrote the text. To all others, it appears as if it were written \nin an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. \nAlternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an \nentirely different message, written in a different hand and \nlanguage, though the language must be one you know.\nShould the spell be dispelled, the original script and the \nillusion both disappear.\nA creature with truesight can read the hidden message.\nMAGIC CIRCLE\n3rd-Ring Arcane and Divine Ritual (Abjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and \niron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou ring a small location with warding magic and arcane runes, \nbarring access for certain types of foes.\nYou create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical \nenergy centered on a point on the ground that you can see \nwithin range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder \nintersects with the floor or other surface.\nChoose one or more of the following types of creatures: \nCelestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle \naffects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:\n• The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by \nnonmagical means. If the creature tries to use \nteleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first \nsucceed on a CHA save.\n• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against \ntargets within the cylinder.\n• Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, \nfrightened, or possessed by the creature.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic \nto operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of \nthe specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting \ntargets outside it.\nMAGIC MOUTH\n2nd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade \ndust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou enchant an object to deliver a short message when the time \nis right.\nYou implant a message within an object in range, a message \nthat is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an \nobject that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried \nby another creature. Then speak the message, which must \nbe 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long \nas 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that \nwill trigger the spell to deliver your message.\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears \non the object and recites the message in your voice and at \nthe same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a \nmouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, \nthe mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so \nthat the words appear to come from the object’s mouth.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after \nit delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its \nmessage whenever the trigger occurs.\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as \ndetailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or \naudible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. \nFor example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when \nany creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a \nsilver bell rings within 30 feet of it.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 92\nPHANTOM STEED\n3rd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Illusion)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou conjure a swift, fragile mount.\nA Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the \nground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. \nYou decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped \nwith a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created \nby the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more \nthan 10 feet away from the steed.\nFor the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride \nthe steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding \nhorse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 \nmiles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell \nends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute \nto dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss \nit, if the steed takes any damage, or you cast this spell to \nsummon a different steed.\nPRAYER OF HEALING\n2nd-Ring Divine Ritual (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V \nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou spend ten minutes beseeching for aid to be visited upon you \nand your living allies.\nUp to six creatures of your choice that you can see \nwithin range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your \nspellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on \nUndead or Constructs.\nOnce you cast this spell, you can’t do so again until you \ncomplete a long rest.\nAs you unlock higher rings, this ritual grows in potency. \nOnce you have access to 3rd-ring spell slots or higher, the \nhealing increases by 1d8 for each spell ring above 3rd.\nTINY HUT\n3rd-Ring Arcane Ritual (Evocation)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self (10-foot radius hemisphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a small crystal bead)\nDuration: 8 hours\nA protective dome springs up around you, a refuge for you and \nthose close to you.\nA 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into \nexistence around and above you and remains stationary for \nthe duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.\nNine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside \nthe dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a \nlarger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures \nand objects within the dome when you cast this spell can \nmove through it freely. All other creatures and objects are \nbarred from passing through it. Spells and other magical \neffects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through \nit. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, \nregardless of the weather outside.\nUntil the spell ends, you can command the interior to \nbecome dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the \noutside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from \nthe inside.\nUNSEEN SERVANT\n1st-Ring Arcane Ritual (Conjuration)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)\nDuration: 1 hour\nAn invisible servant of meager resources carries out a variety of \nlow-skill tasks at your command.\nThis spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force \nthat performs simple tasks at your command until the spell \nends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied \nspace on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, \na STR modifier of −4, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit \npoints, the spell ends.\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can \nmentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and \ninteract with an object. The servant can perform simple \ntasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching \nthings, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting \nfires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the \ncommand, the servant performs the task to the best of its \nability until it completes the task, then waits for your next \ncommand.\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would \nmove it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.\nIf you cast this spell again while a servant created by the \nfirst casting is still active, the servant created from the first \ncasting is immediately destroyed.\n93 Chaptier 4: Spellcasting\nAdditional Spell Descriptions\nThis section presents additional primordial or wyrd spells \n(and one ritual).

The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a \nfailed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nCreatures are affected even if they hold their breath or \ndon’t need to breathe.\nThe fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each \nof your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The \nvapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the \nland, even pouring down openings.\nAt Higher Rings.

For \nthe duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into \ndifficult terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the \nspell must succeed on a STR save or be restrained by the \nentangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained \nby the plants can use its action to make a STR check against \nyour spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

The spell ends if you dismiss it as \nan action or if you cast it again.\nYou can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends \nthe spell.

        "CHAPTER 5: MONSTERS\nDOOM BY ENCOUNTER TIER\nENCOUNTER CR DOOM\n0–4 1\n5–8 2\n9–12 3\n13–16 4\n17–20 5\n21+ 6\nHow to Use These Monsters\nRules for understanding the statistics of monsters (often \ncalled “creatures”) are described in this chapter. If you’re a \nGame Master (GM), look this over and familiarize yourself \nwith the elements of a creature and its statistics before \nusing a creature in your game. \nDescription and Lore. Each creature entry includes \nan italicized description of it as well as lore describing \nthe creature’s origins, typical motives, and similar. The \nitalicized description at the top of each entry is written as if \nthe player characters (PCs) just stumbled upon the creature \nand often can be read aloud to your players when their \ncharacters first encounter the creature. \nElements of a Stat Block\nThe information you need to use a creature in your game \nis organized into an easy-reference format called a stat \nblock. This section describes the meaning of the terms in a \nstat block and the contents of each heading within the stat \nblock. Note that each creature’s stat block has been written \nand organized with an eye toward making creatures faster \nand easier to use during your game, including displaying \nthe precalculated results for ability checks, damage, ability \nscores, and other calculations.\nThis chapter contains more than fifty monsters, including \nNPCs, described with lore, background, and game rules for \nuse at the table.\nOptional Rule: Doom\nAt the start of each combat encounter, the Game Master \n(GM) gains a special resource called Doom based on the \nChallenge Rating (CR) of the encounter, as detailed in the \nDoom by Encounter Tier table. The GM can use Doom \nto influence the results of creature die rolls, turning the \ntide on the player characters (PC) or helping a creature \nlast just one turn longer. The GM can spend Doom in the \nfollowing ways:\n• Give a creature advantage on an attack roll\n• Give a PC disadvantage on a save\n• Once per encounter, refresh, recharge, or otherwise \ngain one additional use of a limited-use feature, \nsuch as a dragon’s Breath Weapon, a legendary \ncreature’s Legendary Resistance, or a spell in a mage’s \nSpellcasting.\nDoom is optional and exists to give creatures some extra \nstaying power against particularly powerful, crafty, or \nresourceful PCs. Keep in mind, Doom doesn’t have to be \nused in every combat encounter. As a GM, consider using \nDoom in an encounter if:\n• The combat encounter is likely the only combat \nencounter the PCs will face that day, and the PCs are \nwell-rested.\n• You have multiple experienced players.\n• You have more than four players. \n• Your players’ characters have extra magic items, \nresources, optimized statistics, or similar aspects that \nmake them tougher than average PCs.\n• If the encounter is particularly significant to the story, \nsuch as the fight against the leader of an antagonistic \norganization working against the PCs, the final fight of \na major story arc, or a climactic fight against a powerful \nantagonist.\n97 Chaptier 5: Monsters\nNAME\nThis is what most people call this kind of creature. Some \ncreatures have alternate names, regional names, or even \nspecific titles, all of which are included in its lore.\nCHALLENGE RATING\nA creature’s challenge rating (CR) tells you how great a \nthreat the creature is. An appropriately equipped and \nwell-rested party of four adventurers should be able to \ndefeat a creature with a CR equal to its level without \nsuffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level \ncharacters should find a creature with a CR of 3 to be a \nworthy challenge, but not a deadly one.\nCreatures that are significantly weaker than 1st-level \ncharacters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Creatures \nwith a rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; \nthose with no effective attacks are worth 0 experience \npoints (XP), while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP \neach.\nSome creatures present a greater challenge than even a \ntypical 20th-level party can handle. These creatures have \na CR of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test \nplayer skill.\nUSING CHALLENGE RATING\nCR ranges from 0 up to 30, with fractions of 1/8, 1/4, and \n1/2 between 0 and 1. In addition to helping determine the \nchallenge compared to a party of PCs, CR can also help \ncompare the challenge of one creature to another. For \ninstance, a CR 2 creature is significantly less challenging \nthan a CR 8 creature.\nDepending on the level of the PCs, creatures within a \nrange of CRs tend to work better than those outside of this \nrange. A CR that’s significantly lower than the PC party \nlevel doesn’t provide sufficient challenge. A CR that’s too \nhigh can be frustrating or even deadly to the PCs.\nThe PC Level to Creature CR Comparison table shows \nthe range of creature CRs that tend to match well with PCs \nof a given level. The lower number represents the lowest \nCR likely to challenge the PCs (often in massed numbers), \nwhile the higher number represents the highest creature \nCR the PCs can likely defeat in combat.\nPC LEVEL TO CREATURE CR COMPARISON\nPC LEVEL SUITABLE CREATURE CRS\n1 0–1/2\n2–4 1/8–6\n5–10 1–15\n11–16 3–21\n17–20 5–30\nEXPERIENCE POINTS BY CHALLENGE RATING\nCR XP CR XP CR XP\n0 0 or 10 9 5,000 21 33,000\n1/8 25 10 5,900 22 41,000\n1/4 50 11 7,200 23 50,000\n1/2 100 12 8,400 24 62,000\n1 200 13 10,000 25 75,000\n2 450 14 11,500 26 90,000\n3 700 15 13,000 27 105,000\n4 1,100 16 15,000 28 120,000\n5 1,800 17 18,000 29 135,000\n6 2,300 18 20,000 30 155,000\n7 2,900 19 22,000\n8 3,900 20 25,000\nEXPERIENCE POINTS\nThe number of experience points (XP) a creature is worth \nis based on its CR. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating \na creature, although the GM may also award XP for \nneutralizing the threat posed by the creature in some other \nmanner.\nSIZE\nThis is the relative size of the creature. A creature can be \nTiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The \nSize Categories table shows how much space a creature of a \nparticular size occupies on a battle map or grid.\nSIZE CATEGORIES\nSIZE SPACE EXAMPLES\nTiny 2.5 x 2.5 ft. Imp, sprite\nSmall 5 x 5 ft. Giant rat, goblin\nMedium 5 x 5 ft. Orc, werewolf\nLarge 10 x 10 ft. Hippogriff, ogre\nHuge 15 x 15 ft. Fire giant, treant\nGargantuan 20 x 20 ft. or larger Kraken, purple worm\nTYPE\nA creature’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain \nspells, magic items, class features, and other effects interact \nin special ways with creatures of a particular type. For \nexample, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage to \ncreatures of the dragon type, such as red dragons, dragon \nturtles, and wyverns. Here is an overview of each of the \ncreature types. For a more detailed look at creature types, \nsee Chapter 3.\nAberrations are utterly alien beings. Many have \ninnate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien \nmind rather than the mystical forces of the world. \nQuintessential aberrations are creatures like aboleths, \nchuul, and gibbering mouthers.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 98\nMonstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense—\nfrightening, abnormal creatures, not truly natural, and \nalmost never benign. Some are the result of magical \nexperimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), others are \nthe product of terrible curses (such as chimeras), and many \nare monstrous animals (such as griffons). Monstrosities \ndefy categorization, and in some sense, serve as a catch-all \ncategory for creatures that don’t fit another type.\nOozes are gelatinous predators without fixed forms. \nThese mindless eating machines consume anything \nthey can dissolve, living or otherwise. They are mostly \nsubterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding \non refuse, carrion, or living creatures unlucky enough to \nget in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are \namong the most recognizable oozes.\nPlants are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. \nMost are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The \nquintessential plants are the shambling mound and the \ntreant. Fungal creatures such as shriekers and mycolids \nalso fall into this category.\nUndead are formerly living creatures brought to a state \nof undeath through the practice of necromantic magic, \ndark rites, or curses. Undead creatures include mindless \nanimated corpses like zombies, potent predators like \nvampires, and tormented souls that lack a body, like ghosts \nor specters.\nCATEGORIES\nSome creatures fall into categories that are a bit more \nspecific than their creature types but not as game \nrule-related as tags. This categorization denotes the \ncreatures are more closely related to each other than they \nare to other creatures of their same creature type, but \nthere aren’t many, if any at all, game rules that reference \nor rely on that category. Categories are especially helpful \nwhen determining which creatures might be found \ntogether or working alongside each other. For example, \nbugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins are all part of the \ngoblin family, regularly work together, and often inhabit \nthe same areas. As such, they are listed as “Goblin, \nCreature Name” in this book. \nTAGS\nCreatures may have various tags that further specify their \ncreature type. If a creature has a tag, it appears as part of \nthe creature’s stat block in parentheses after size and type. \nTags indicate creatures that can be targeted by specific \nspells, magic items, and other features available to PCs. \nFor example, the moonbeam spell has special effects against \ncreatures with the Shapechanger tag. \nIf a creature has a subtag, the creature is considered to \nbe both its tag and its subtag, though only the subtag is \nlisted in the creature’s stat block. For example, a werewolf \nis both a Lycanthrope and a Shapechanger—though only \nBeasts are living creatures of the natural world. Beasts \ninclude all varieties of wild animals, domesticated animals, \nand enormous creatures such as whales and dinosaurs.\nCelestials dwell in higher realms outside of measurable \nor material reality. Many are servants of deities, acting as \nmessengers, heralds, or agents in the mortal realm. Most of \nthem lean innately toward forces of good and order. All of \nthem strive to oppose or destroy Fiends. Celestials include \nbeings like angels, couatls, and pegasi.\nConstructs are made, not born. Often built of metal, \nstone, or wood, some are charged by their creators to follow \na simple set of instructions, while others are given sentience \nand use independent thought. Golems, mechadrons, and \nclockwork creatures are iconic constructs.\nDragons are large, reptilian creatures of ancient origin \nand tremendous power. True dragons are highly intelligent, \nhave innate magic, and grow in power as they increase in \nage, called age categories. The dragon creature type also \nincludes creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less \npowerful, less magical, and often less intelligent, such as \nwyverns and pseudodragons.\nElementals are creatures born of raw elemental forces. \nSome creatures of this type are little more than animate \nmasses of their respective elements, including the creatures \nsimply called elementals. Others have biological forms \ninfused with elemental energy. Elemental creatures include \nbeings like genies, azers, and invisible stalkers.\nFey are magical creatures bound to the forces of nature. \nThey dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some \nworlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild or the Bright \nLands, also called the Plane of Fey. Some are also found in \nthe Outer Planes, particularly in the Shadow Realm. Fey \ninclude dryads, sprites, and satyrs.\nFiends dwell in lower realms outside of measurable or \nmaterial reality. A few are servants of deities, but many \nmore labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon \nprinces. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends \nto the material world to do their bidding. Most fiends lean \ninnately toward forces of evil and chaos. All of them strive \nto oppose or destroy Celestials. Fiends include demons, \ndevils, hell hounds, and rakshasas.\nGiants are enormous, powerful beings that tower over \nlesser creatures. They are humanlike in shape, though some \nbear unique adaptations that allow them to thrive in the \nharsh environments they claim. True giants include stone \ngiants, fire giants, and cloud giants, but this category also \nincludes lesser giants, such as ogres and trolls.\nHumanoids are usually bipedal and often warm-blooded, \nincluding humans and a prodigious variety of other \nlineages. The most common Humanoids are the lineages \navailable to player characters (PCs), including humans, \ndwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous are \nbeings like goblinoids, gnolls, and lizardfolk.\n99 Chaptier 5: Monsters\nLycanthrope is listed in its stat block—and it is affected \nby spells, magic items, and other features that affect \nShapechangers or Lycanthropes. The following are the \nmost commonly used tags and their associated subtags:\nAnimal. A creature that is not of the Beast type but shares \nenough characteristics with Beasts that it can be affected \nby spells, features, or other abilities that specifically target \nBeasts, such as the speak with animals spell. \nGolem. A specific type of Construct that is almost always \nhumanoid in shape, is typically crafted wholly out of a \nspecific material, and has some magical connection to \nits creator. This connection might be that the golem was \nmade from the remains of the creator’s loved one, made \nwith some of the creator’s blood, made from an object with \ngreat sentimental significance to the creator, or some other \nobject or material personal to the creator.\nOutsider. A creature from another plane or realm not \nbound by laws of material or measurable reality. There \nare a wide range of Outsiders from a variety of planes and \nrealms. Some of the most common Outsiders are Angels, \nDemons, and Devils, which are defined as the following:\n• Angel. A specific kind of Celestial Outsider bound in \nservice to gods of good and order.\n• Demon. A specific type of Fiend Outsider bound to the \nforces of evil and chaos.\n• Devil. A specific type of Fiend Outsider bound in \nservice to gods or fiendish lords of evil and order.\nShapechanger. A creature capable of changing form, \nsuch as werewolves, doppelgangers, and vampires. This tag \napplies only to creatures with the natural ability to change \ntheir shape. It doesn’t apply to creatures that use magic—\nwhether or not that magic is innate to the creature—to \nchange their shape, such as gold dragons.\n• Lycanthrope. A specific kind of Humanoid \nShapechanger that changes its shape due to an \nanimalistic curse called lycanthropy, allowing the \ncreature to transform to and from an Animal form, its \nHumanoid form, and a hybrid of the two. The curse is \ntypically passed by an attack from another Lycanthrope \nor by the creature having a Lycanthrope parent. \nThough all Lycanthropes are Shapechangers, not all \nShapechangers are Lycanthropes.\nARMOR CLASS (AC)\nArmor Class represents the creature’s defenses, often \nabbreviated to AC. The higher the number, the more \ndifficult the creature is to hit in combat.\nThe armor a creature uses (if any) is placed in parentheses \nafter the AC value to help GMs alter the number if the \ncreature’s armor is removed in some special circumstance.\nThe AC included in each stat block has been calculated \nusing the following formula. Keep in mind that AC is \ncalculated before proficiency bonus (PB) is added to the \nAbility Modifiers as explained in the Ability Modifiers \nsection, presented later in this chapter:\nAC = 10 + DEX modifier + Any Additional Bonuses \n(from equipment, natural armor, or special traits)\nHIT POINTS (HP)\nHit Points represent the health and vitality of the creature, \noften abbreviated to HP. The higher the number, the harder \nit is to kill or knock out the creature. Unlike PCs, creatures \ntypically die or are destroyed when reduced to 0 HP.\nSPEED\nA creature’s speed defines how far it can move during a \nsingle round of combat. If the creature has multiple ways \nto move (such as swimming or flying), those are also listed \nin this section. All creatures have a walking speed, simply \ncalled speed. Creatures with no ground-based movement \nhave a walking speed of 0 feet. Some creatures have one or \nmore of the following additional ways to move. \nBURROW\nA creature with a burrowing speed can move through sand, \nearth, mud, or ice. A creature can’t burrow through solid \nrock unless it has a trait that allows it to do so.\nCLIMB\nA creature with a climbing speed can move on vertical \nsurfaces with no check required. The creature doesn’t need \nto spend extra movement to climb.\nFLY\nA creature with a flying speed can move by flying. Some \ncreatures can hover, which makes them hard to knock \nout of the air. Such a creature stops hovering when it \ndies. If a creature can hover, the word “hover” appears in \nparenthesis after its fly speed.\nSWIM\nA creature with a swimming speed can move easily through \nliquid and doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.\nUSING DIFFERENT SPEEDS\nIf a creature has more than one speed, such as a walking \nspeed and a flying speed, it can switch back and forth \nbetween its speeds during its move. Whenever the creature \nswitches, subtract the distance the creature has already \nmoved from the new speed. The result determines how \nmuch farther the creature can move. If the result is 0 \nor less, the creature can’t use the new speed during the \ncurrent move.\nFor example, if a creature has a speed of 30 and a flying \nspeed of 60, the creature could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 \nfeet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 100\nPERCEPTION\nThe Perception Value shows how observant the creature \nis, regardless of whether it’s actively looking around. This \nPerception Value is calculated using a creature’s Wisdom \n(WIS).\nA PC attempting to hide from, sneak around, or stage \na surprise attack against a creature must make a DEX \n(Stealth) check. If the result is equal to or higher than the \ncreature’s Perception Value, the PC succeeds and remains \nundetected. If it is lower, the PC fails, and the creature \ndetects the character.\nFor instance, a goblin has a Perception Value of 9. A PC \nmust roll a 9 or better on a DEX (Stealth) check to sneak \npast it.\nThe Perception Value included in each stat block has been \ncalculated using the following formula. Some creatures \nare naturally perceptive, which allows them to add their PB \nor even double their PB when calculating their Perception \nValue. In such cases, the Perception value in the stat block \nalready includes that bonus.\nPerception Value = 10 + WIS modifier\nSTEALTH\nThe Stealth Value shows how readily a creature evades \nnotice—either to sneak around or stage a surprise attack. \nStealth is calculated using a creature’s Dexterity (DEX).\nA PC searching for unseen foes must make a WIS \n(Perception) check. If the result is equal to or higher than \nthe creature’s Stealth score, the PC succeeds and detects \nsigns of the creature. If it is lower, the PC fails, and the \ncreature remains undetected.\nFor instance, a goblin has a Stealth Value of 14. A PC must \nroll a 14 or better on a WIS (Perception) check to detect the \ngoblin when it is trying to hide.\nThe Stealth Value included in each stat block has been \ncalculated using the following formula. Some creatures \nare naturally stealthy, which allows them to add their PB or \neven double their PB when calculating their Stealth Value. \nIn such cases, the Stealth value in the stat block already \nincludes that bonus.\nStealth Value = 10 + DEX modifier\nIMMUNE, RESISTANT, AND VULNERABLE\nSome creatures are vulnerable, resistant, or immune to \ncertain kinds of damage or conditions. Particular creatures \nare even vulnerable, resistant, or immune to damage from \nnonmagical attacks. A magical attack is an attack delivered \nby a spell, a magic item, or another magical source.\nMultiple Protective Sources. Multiple instances of a \ncreature being resistant or vulnerable to a type of damage \ncount as only one instance. For example, if a creature \nhas resistance to fire damage, such as a from its natural \ncapabilities or the protection from energy spell, as well as \nresistance to nonmagical damage, such as from the gaseous \nform spell, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by \nhalf against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\nConditions and Damage. Each creature has only one line \nfor each of the following categories. This means a creature \nresistant to cold damage and the grappled condition lists \nboth cold and grappled in the Resistant line. In many cases, \na creature being vulnerable, resistant, or immune to a \ncondition is due to its creature type, which is noted as the \nassociated trait’s name in the appropriate category line and \ndetailed in the traits section of the stat block.\nVULNERABLE\nIf a creature is vulnerable to a type of damage and it takes \ndamage of that type, the damage is doubled against the \ncreature. For instance, a creature vulnerable to fire damage \ntakes double damage from a fireball spell or flaming oil.\nA creature that is vulnerable to a condition has \ndisadvantage on checks and saves made to avoid becoming \naffected by that condition or to end it.\nRESISTANT\nIf a creature is resistant to a type of damage and it takes \ndamage of that type, the damage is halved (rounded down) \nagainst the creature. \nA creature that is resistant to a condition has advantage \non checks and saves made to avoid becoming affected by \nthat condition or to end it.\nIMMUNE\nIf a creature is immune to a type of damage, it doesn’t take \ndamage of that type or lose hit points when subjected to \nthat type of damage. If a spell, class feature, or other effect \ndeals damage of a type to which a creature is immune \nand has an extra effect, such as causing the charmed \nor frightened condition, the creature doesn’t take that \ndamage, but it might still be subjected to that extra effect. \nFor example, a creature immune to bludgeoning damage \nwould be immune to the bludgeoning damage of an \notyugh’s Tentacle Slam, but it might still become stunned if \nit fails the CON save from Tentacle Slam.\nA creature that is immune to a condition automatically \nsucceeds on checks and saves to avoid the condition and \notherwise can’t be affected by that condition.\nSENSES\nCreatures primarily perceive the world by sight. This is \ncalled vision. Creatures usually have secondary senses \nof hearing, smell, and touch that also allow them to \ninteract with the environment, but vision is considered the \n“standard” primary sense.\nIf a creature has no unusual sensory capacity, this section \n101 Chaptier 5: Monsters\nis marked with “—”. If a creature has a specialized sense \nthat allows it to perceive in some way other than vision, it \nis noted in the senses line, followed by a radius in feet that \ndefines the sense’s maximum range. Specialized senses \nthat appear in a stat block:\nDARKVISION\nA creature with darkvision can see in nonmagical darkness. \nThe creature can see in dim light within the radius as if \nit were bright light and can see in darkness as if it were \ndim light. A creature can’t discern color in darkness, only \nshades of gray. Many nocturnal creatures and creatures \nthat live underground have this special sense.\nKEENSENSE\nA creature with keensense can perceive its surroundings \nusing a sense other than vision. Creatures without \nvision, such as morlocks and gelatinous cubes, typically \nhave this sense, as do creatures with echolocation or an \nextraordinary sense of smell, such as bats and true dragons.\nIf a creature has no other form of sensing, it has a \nparenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the \nradius of its keensense defines the maximum range of its \nperception.\nTREMORSENSE\nA creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the \nsource of vibrations if it and the source are in contact with \nthe same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t detect \nflying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, \nsuch as ankhegs and purple worms, have this special sense.\nTRUESIGHT\nA creature with truesight can see clearly in normal and \nmagical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, \nautomatically detect and succeed on saves against visual \nillusions, and perceive the original form of a Shapechanger \nor creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the \ncreature can see into the Ethereal Plane within range.\nLANGUAGES\nThe languages that a creature can speak are listed in \nalphabetical order. If a creature can understand a language \nbut can’t speak it, this is noted on this line. A “—” \nindicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands \nany language. Most languages are specific to a particular \nheritage or culture; a few are based on faith, commerce, or \ntraveler’s tongues. \nTELEPATHY\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature to \nmentally communicate with another creature within a \nspecified range. A telepathic creature can start or end a \ntelepathic conversation at will, without using an action, \nlike talking. A telepathic creature doesn’t need to see a \ncontacted creature to communicate, it just needs to be \nin range.\nA telepathic creature can communicate with a creature \nthat doesn’t have telepathy. The contacted creature doesn’t \nneed to share a language with the telepathic creature to \ncommunicate, but it must be able to understand at least \none language. The contacted creature can receive and \nrespond to telepathic messages, but it can’t start or end \ntelepathic communication.\nContact breaks if two creatures are no longer within \nrange of each other or if the telepathic creature contacts \na different creature. While a telepathic creature is \nincapacitated, it can’t start telepathy, and any contact ends.\nA creature in an antimagic field or in any location where \nmagic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic \nmessages.\nABILITY MODIFIERS\nEvery creature has six ability modifiers: Strength (STR), \nDexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), \nWisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA). These modifiers are \nused to determine pre-calculated elements of a stat block \n(like attack and damage). More importantly, the GM uses \nthem whenever a creature must make:\n• A save. The GM rolls a d20 and adds the relevant ability \nmodifier.\n• An ability check. The GM rolls a d20 and adds \nwhichever ability modifier is most relevant.\nIf a creature is particularly good at checks and saves \ninvolving a certain ability, the creature’s proficiency bonus \n(PB) has already been added into the ability modifiers \npresented in the stat block. You don’t need to add PB to \nany number in a stat block—it’s already calculated for you.\nTRAITS\nTraits are a creature’s special characteristics that are likely \nto be relevant in combat. In a stat block, they appear after a \ncreature’s ability modifiers but before any actions. \nACTIONS\nWhen a creature takes its action, it can choose from the \noptions in the Actions section of its stat block or use one \nof the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash \nor Hide action, as described in the Combat rules (see \nChapter 2).\nMELEE AND RANGED ATTACKS\nThe most common actions that a creature takes in combat \nare melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or \nweapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a physical \nBlack Flag Roleplaying 102\nitem or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.\nCreature vs. Target.The target of a melee or ranged attack \nis usually either one creature or one target. The difference \nis that a “target” can be a creature, object, or structure. \nThis designator on an attack reflects the creature’s natural \ninclination, but it doesn’t mean a tyrannosaurus rex can’t \nor won’t bite at a door to get to a creature it can smell on \nthe other side. This designator helps reflect that a creature \nlike a tyrannosaurus rex isn’t likely to strategically attack \npillars of a building to make the building collapse on its \nprey or to otherwise attack an object or structure in a way \nthat isn’t directly related to reaching its prey.\nHit. Any damage dealt and other effects that occur as a \nresult of an attack hitting a target are described after the \n“Hit:” notation. In the Alpha Release, you might notice \nthe math doesn’t match up perfectly. We’re trying some \nthings to bring the power curve up a bit. Don’t sweat the \narithmetic for now. But do note how the damage values \nwork for your table.\nMULTIATTACK\nA creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has \nthe Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack \nwhen making an opportunity attack, which must be a \nsingle melee attack.\nAMMUNITION\nA creature carries enough ammunition to make its \nranged attacks. A creature generally has 2d4 pieces of \nammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces \nof ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or \ncrossbow.\nSPELLCASTING\nA creature with the Spellcasting action is capable of \ncasting spells through innate magical talent. Unless noted \notherwise, a spell of 1st ring or higher is always cast at its \nlowest possible ring and can’t be cast at a higher ring. If a \ncreature has a cantrip where its spellcaster level matters \nand no level is given, use the creature’s challenge rating.\nA creature doesn’t adhere to the tenets, restrictions, or \nrequirements of specific spellcasting classes, circles of \nmagic, or similar spellcasting structures found among \nplayer characters, as a creature’s spellcasting is unique to \nthe creature. A creature’s spells can’t be swapped out with \nother spells.\nSPELL ATTACKS AND SAVE DCS\nThe Spellcasting action always lists the creature’s \nspellcasting ability and the spell save DC for its spells. \nWhen a spell requires a spell attack roll, use the creature’s \nspellcasting ability modifier + the creature’s proficiency \nbonus to determine the creature’s total spell attack bonus.\nSPELL COMPONENTS\nThe Spellcasting action always notes if the creature doesn’t \nneed to use a particular type of spell component, such \nas material components. If no exception is listed in the \ncreature’s Spellcasting action, the creature must provide all \nnecessary components to cast the spell. For the purposes of \ncasting a spell, a creature needs free use of at least one limb \nto produce gestures for somatic components rather than \nspecifically free use of one hand. \nBONUS ACTIONS\nIf a creature can do something special with its bonus \naction, that information is contained here. If a creature has \nno special bonus action, this section is absent.\nREACTIONS\nIf a creature can do something special with its reaction, \nthat information is contained here. If a creature has no \nspecial reaction, this section is absent.\nLIMITED USAGE\nSome traits or actions have restrictions on the number of \ntimes they can be used. Common examples:\nX/Day. This means a special ability can be used a \nlimited number of times in a day, where “X” is a number \n(often 1 or 3). The creature must finish a long rest to \nregain expended uses.\nFor example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used \nonce and then the creature must finish a long rest to use it \nagain.\nRecharge X–Y. This means a creature can use a special \nability once. Afterward, the ability has a random chance \nof recharging during each round of combat. “X” and “Y” \nare values on a d6 (often 5 and 6). At the start of each of \nthe creature’s turns, roll a d6. If the result is in the range of \nnumbers in the recharge notation, the creature regains the \nuse of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the \ncreature finishes a short or long rest.\nFor example, “Recharge 5–6” means a creature can use the \nspecial ability once. Then, at the start of the creature’s turn, \nit regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\nRecharge after a Short or Long Rest. This means that a \ncreature can use a special ability once and then must finish \na short or long rest to use it again.\nConditional. This covers a lot of territory where an ability \ncan be used only after a certain condition is met. This \ninformation always appears in parenthesis. For example, \n“Vicious Bound (44 HP or Fewer)” means a creature can’t \nuse the Vicious Bound action unless it has 44 hit points \n(HP) or fewer remaining.\nEQUIPMENT\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than a \ncreature’s armor or weapons. A creature that customarily \nwears clothes, such as a Humanoid, is assumed to be \ndressed appropriately.\nA GM can equip creatures with additional gear and \n103 Chaptier 5: Monsters\ntrinkets as desired. The GM decides how much of a \ncreature’s equipment is recoverable after it is slain and \nwhether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered \nsuit of armor made for a creature is rarely usable by \nsomeone else, for instance.\nIf a spellcasting creature needs material components to \ncast its spells, assume that it has what it needs to cast the \nspells in its stat block.\nLEGENDARY CREATURES\nA legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures \ncan’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it \nmight exert magical influence for miles around.\nIf a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, \nsuch as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s \nlegendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\nLEGENDARY ACTIONS\nA legendary creature can take a certain number of special \nactions—called legendary actions—outside its turn. Only \none legendary action option can be used at a time and only \nat the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its \nspent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It doesn’t \nhave to use them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated \nor otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t \nuse them until after its first turn in the combat.\nLAIRS\nA legendary creature might have a section describing its lair \nand the special effects it can create while there, either by act \nof will or simply by being present. Such a section applies \nonly to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time \nin its lair.\nLAIR ACTIONS\nIf a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to \nharness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count \n20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action \noptions. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise \nunable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until \nafter its first turn in the combat.\nREGIONAL EFFECTS\nThe mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange \nand wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this \nsection. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over \ntime when the legendary creature dies.\nMONSTERS A TO Z\nThis section contains creature entries in alphabetical order \nwith Animals and NPCs listed in separate sections at the \nend.\nAnimated Objects\nThe emptiness within the suit of plate mail’s visor demonstrates \nthat no creature controls the armor from inside it. An iron sword \nfloats in midair at rest—then suddenly swings and flourishes as \nthough wielded by a trained swordfighter.\nAnimated objects are nonmagical objects given life by \na spellcaster. Though little more than their mundane \ncounterparts, animated objects can be given basic \ninstructions to follow indefinitely or until given new \ninstructions by their creators. The most common animated \nobjects are decorative or seemingly innocuous armor \nand weapons instructed to protect their creators’ homes, \nlaboratories, treasuries, or other locations important to \ntheir creators.\nAnimated Armor. Crafted to look like field armor with \ndents and scratches showing signs of its use in battle, or \nornately decorated for those who want something more \naesthetically pleasing, animated armor moves as quickly as \nthose who might wear it. It pummels foes with its gauntlets \nbut can kick or otherwise ram opponents in the absence of \nits gauntlets.\nFlying Sword. Often paired with animated armor, a \nflying sword appears equally as battle-worn or ornate as \nthe accompanying armor. The sword may also sit alone, \ninnocuous among a rack of weapons, ready to fly out at \nintruders. Though more maneuverable than most animated \nobjects, its fragility makes it easier to destroy.\nAnimated Armor CR 1\nMedium Construct \nArmor Class 18 (natural armor)\nHit Points 34\nSpeed 25 ft.\nPerception 8 Stealth 10\nVulnerable acid\nResistant slashing\nImmune Construct Resilience\nSenses keensense 60 ft.

Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. \nHit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage.\nBONUS ACTIONS\nHelmet Bash (19 HP or Fewer). The animated armor slams \nits helmet into a creature it can sense within 5 feet of it.

The flying sword makes a \nSlash attack against a target it can sense within 5 feet of it.\nCrimson Jelly\nAs light probes the darkness, it strikes a tiny oval-shaped bubble. \nWithin its translucent form, strings of undulating comb-like \nstructures scintillate with an eerie crimson glow. \nCrimson jellies drift upon the currents of the endless \ndarkness in deep waters or the underworld. These \naggressive carnivores feed upon whatever creatures they \ncome across. Their translucent forms are nearly invisible, \nand they move so rapidly, few creatures realize their \npresence until a jelly begins feasting on them.\nSwarming. Crimson jellies reproduce asexually and \nwith extreme speed. Almost immediately after feeding, \nthe creatures break away from prey and divide. Within \nmoments of encountering a single jelly, the unwary can be \noverwhelmed by a growing mob of ravenous jellies.\nCrimson Jelly CR 1/2\nTiny Ooze\nArmor Class 12\nHit Points 20\nSpeed 0 ft., fly 60 ft.

The crimson jelly doesn’t require sleep.\nOoze Resilience. The crimson jelly is resistant to the grappled \nand restrained conditions, and it is immune to exhaustion \nand to the blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, and \nprone conditions.\n105 Chaptier 5: Monsters\nTainted Attacks. A creature that is reduced to 0 HP by a \ncrimson jelly must succeed on a DC 9 CHA save or suffer \none level of exhaustion. While a creature suffers from this \nexhaustion, it loses most of its memories aside from basic \ninformation about itself, such as its name and its capabilities, \nand it is wracked with nightmarish visions that include a \ncrimson rune.\nTransparent. While in an area of dim or bright light, the \ncrimson jelly is invisible. While in darkness, creatures without \ndarkvision can see the jelly’s faint crimson glow.\nACTIONS\nFeeding Paddles. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., \none creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The crimson \njelly gains temporary HP equal to the necrotic damage dealt, \nand it attaches to the target. If the jelly had advantage on \nthis attack, it attaches to the target’s face, leaving the target \nunable to breathe or speak while the jelly is attached. \nWhile attached, the crimson jelly can use only the Feeding \nPaddles action, and it moves with the target whenever the \ntarget moves, requiring none of the jelly’s movement. The \nCrimson jelly can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its \nmovement. A creature, including the target, can take its \naction to detach the jelly by succeeding on a DC 12 STR \ncheck.\nBONUS ACTIONS\nReproduce (Requires Temporary HP). While the crimson jelly \nhas 1 or more temporary HP, it can split part of itself off into \na new crimson jelly with HP equal to the original crimson \njelly’s temporary HP.

Without regular trips to other planes, some \nlesser demons eventually wear away as the reality-bending \nchaos consumes them. What remains is known as a husk \ndemon.\nExpunged. Drained by the chaos and endless fury, little \nremains of what these demons once were, save for rage \nand hunger. Husk demons seek to consume the souls of \nsentient creatures from other planes, a whisper of their \ndemonic form promising relief in the pits of the Abyss, if \nonly they can consume enough souls. These demons slurp \nat the bodies and souls of creatures, steadily leeching the \nvitality and thirst for life from victims. After a kill, many \nhusk demons burn and mutilate their victim with a mark of \ntheir patron demon. Whether the husk demon recalls the \nmeaning of the mark remains uncertain.\nTied to the Past. Husk demons inhabit the ruins of \ndemonic strongholds, ancient demonic prisons, or temples \non the Material Plane dedicated to dead gods or infernal \nexiles. Such sites often contain lost relics and artifacts \nto which the demons shared a distant connection in life. \nExperienced scavengers and looters tend to avoid areas \nsaid to be inhabited by husk demons, believing the demons \nto be long-dead guardians pressed into service by the \npowerful objects themselves. Unfortunate explorers or \ntravelers seeking shelter from the weather may accidentally \nwander into such places on the Material Plane and find \nthemselves surrounded by these starving fiends.\nHusk Demon CR 4 \nMedium Fiend (Demon)\nArmor Class 15\nHit Points 82\nSpeed 40 ft., fly 25 ft.\nPerception 13 Stealth 15 \nResistant Demonic Resilience\nImmune necrotic | exhaustion, prone | Demonic Resilience\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\nLanguages Abyssal, telepathy 60 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+1 +5 +3 −2 −1 −3\nAmorphous.

It gazes with \nexpressionless, black eyes.\nQuasits take to mortal worlds to escape bullying from \nmost other demons and to spread Abyssal destruction \nthere by making themselves available as familiars to \nspellcasters. While serving as familiars, quasits goad their \nmasters into vile acts. These acts often start small and \nsimple, slowly escalating until the master has been fully \ncorrupted by the quasit’s influence. \nCowardly Shapechangers.

Humanoids suffering from tyrannosaurus \npredation keep tyrannosaur skulls as trophies when they \nmanage to defeat the dinosaurs.

The target must make a DC 12 STR save, taking \n10 (4d4) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much \ndamage on a successful one.\nDragon, Black\nThis dragon has glossy black scales pitted gray and white with \nacid stains. Its crocodilian maw continually dribbles acid that \nhisses when it strikes something.\nBlack dragons are consummate bullies and aggressively \ndefend their lairs against lesser creatures, often making \nexamples of those they see as a threat. This also applies \nto their mates and their own young, which flee the most \npowerful specimen when they can. If a dragon learns about \na settlement encroaching on its swampy domain, it first \nsends its allies to drive the interlopers away, and then it \nmakes a personal visit to destroy any remaining resistance.\nCowardly. As bullies, black dragons quail in the face of \nsuperior beings, often in the form of larger black dragons \nresettling from other swampy lairs or their own young \nwho have amassed enough wealth, power, and age to \nchallenge their sire. When necessary, black dragons engage \nin ambushes, short raids, and night attacks to undermine \nstronger foes.\nGem Hoarders. Conditions force black dragons to \ncarefully select their treasures. Metal corrodes from \nexposure to the dragons’ acid and the damp air. Paper \nsoaks through and disintegrates. Wood bloats and warps. \nEnchanted items last longer, but they too ultimately \nsuccumb to corrosion. However, gems persist in the \nunfavorable environment, so black dragons collect as \nmany as possible. Each dragon has a favorite type of gem \nthey covet, ranging from sapphires and rubies through \nless common stones like tourmalines and garnets. While \nthe dragons don’t have deep caverns for their hoards, the \nshallow waters of the swamps make it relatively simple to \ndredge for stored gems.\nLocal Despots. Compared to most chromatic dragons, \nblack dragons content themselves with their own domain \nand rarely see the need to fly somewhere distant, devastate \nan area, and plunder from the fallen. They are satisfied \nwith waylaying hapless travelers in their territory and \nretrieving treasure from those claimed by the swamp \nwithout their intervention.\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The tyrannosaurus makes one Bite attack and \none Tail attack. It can’t make both attacks against the same \ntarget.\nBite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one \ncreature. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is \na Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). \nUntil this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the \ntyrannosaurus can’t Bite another target.\nTail. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one \ncreature. Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.\nBONUS ACTIONS\nRending Shake. While grappling a creature, the tyrannosaurus \nshakes its head, tearing at the creature. The grappled \ncreature must succeed on a DC 16 STR save or take 6 (1d12) \nslashing damage and be thrown up to 20 feet in a random \ndirection and knocked prone. If the thrown target strikes a \nsolid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage \nfor every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at \nanother creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 DEX \nsave or take the same damage and be knocked prone.\nDinosaur, Velociraptor\nA small, wispy-feathered creature with a sweeping tail, vicious \nneedle-like teeth, and hooked claws on its powerful back legs tilts \nits head from side to side before it darts forward.\nAn effective pack hunter, the velociraptor rarely travels \nalone. These dinosaurs spread out from one another and \nsurround their prey, attacking ferociously from blind spots, \nripping and tearing their targets with savage claws on their \nhind legs. Hard to train and forever plagued by instincts \nto kill, only the most foolish and determined humanoids \nattempt to tame velociraptors.

Powerful, intelligent, and cunning, their attacks rend \narmor, and their flaming breath devastates anyone foolish enough \nto stand against them. Older red dragons develop additional \nattacks and even the ability to cast spells.\nAvaricious and Territorial. Most dragons maintain \nhoards of gold, treasure, and magical items, but the greed \nof the red dragons is as legendary as their fire. They amass \nvast troves of wealth, preferring quantity over quality, and \ndisplay trophies and skulls of slain foes prominently. Red \ndragons prefer to lair in volcanic caverns within mountains \nor subterranean areas of extreme heat. They surround their \nhoard chambers with twisting tunnels full of traps and \nguardians provided by the lesser creatures forced to serve \nthem. Red dragons brook no incursions into their territory, \nwhich can stretch for miles around their lairs, and react to \nany perceived trespass with fury and fire.\nDominating Pride. Red dragons truly believe they are the \nmightiest of all dragons and superior to all other creatures. \nThey are quick to boast of their own greatness and happy \nto demonstrate their supremacy by fang or fire. This pride \nmakes them tyrannical, and many red dragons delight in \nforcing tribute or service from lesser creatures.\nIncendiary Rage. The magical core of fire at the heart of \nevery red dragon both generates their incinerating breath \nand makes them quick to anger. They take offense at even \nslight provocation, flying into devastating rages that last \nuntil their fury is vented.\nA RED DRAGON’S LAIR\nA red dragon favors high mountains, claiming snowy \npeaks, fuming volcanoes, or sprawling ancient ruins. A red \ndragon’s immense strength, agile flight, and comfort in \nblistering temperatures make its lair difficult to traverse for \nmost other creatures. From its skyward vantage point, a \nred dragon peers down at what it considers to be lesser kin. \nIn the most extreme lairs, precariously maintained above \nthe churning interior of active volcanoes, red dragons \n109 Chaptier 5: Monsters\nretain azers, fire elementals, fire giants, and devils or \ndemons to serve their whims. Sprawling dwarven tunnels, \nforgotten giant foundries, or lakes of boiling stone make \nthe perfect respite for a red dragon’s clutch or nest.\nLAIR ACTIONS\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a red dragon \ncan take one of the following lair actions. The dragon can’t \nuse the same effect two rounds in a row:\n• Collapse. The ceiling on a point the dragon can see \nwithin 120 feet of it collapses, covering a 20-foot square \narea on the ground directly below that point. Each \ncreature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save \nor be knocked prone and buried under the rubble. A \nburied creature is restrained and unable to breathe or \nstand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can \ntake its action to free the buried creature by succeeding \non a DC 15 STR check while within reach of the buried \ncreature.\n• Swirling Ash. Searing ash blasts a point the dragon can \nsee within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 30 feet of \nthat point must make a DC 15 CON save. On a failure, \na creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and is blinded \nuntil the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature \ntakes half the damage and isn’t blinded. The ash ignites \nflammable objects within 30 feet of that point that \naren’t being worn or carried.\n• Conflagrate. One creature the dragon can see within \n120 feet of it becomes tethered to the Elemental Plane \nof Fire. The target must succeed on a DC 15 CHA save \nor be burned for 1 minute. While burned, the target \ntakes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. \nThe effect ends early if the target takes cold damage, \nis submerged in water, or the burn is removed with a \ngreater restoration spell or similar magic.\nREGIONAL EFFECTS\nThe region containing a red dragon’s lair is suffused \nwith fiery chaos, which creates one or more of the \nfollowing effects.\n• Acid Rain. Within 10 miles of the red dragon’s lair, \nprecipitation is oily and stinks of sulfur. Snow in the \narea may be gray or black as it falls, appearing like ash, \nthough its temperature is unchanged.\n• Incited Rage. Creatures within 3 miles of the red \ndragon’s lair are quick to anger and slow to forgive. \nSuch creatures have disadvantage on CHA checks, \nexcept CHA (Intimidation), and Beasts in the area that \naren’t domesticated are more aggressive than normal.\n• Unnatural Heat. Within 1 mile of the red dragon’s \nlair, temperatures are unnaturally high. Vegetation \nin the area withers and eventually crumbles to dust. \nCreatures in the area require twice as much water as \nnormal each day to survive, and each creature in the \narea must succeed on a DC 10 CON save every hour it \nremains in the area or suffer one level of exhaustion. \nCreatures that are resistant or immune to fire damage \nare unaffected by this regional effect.\nRed Dragon Wyrmling CR 4 \nMedium Dragon \nArmor Class 17 (natural armor)\nHit Points 85\nSpeed 30 ft., climb 30 ft., fly 60 ft.\nPerception 14 Stealth 12\nImmune fire\nSenses darkvision 60 ft., keensense 10 ft. \nLanguages Draconic\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+4 +2 +5 +1 +2 +4\nPounce.

If a creature’s save succeeds \nor the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the \ndragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.\nFire Breath (Recharge 5–6). The dragon exhales fire in a \n60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 \nDEX save, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed save, or \nhalf as much damage on a successful one.\nLEGENDARY ACTIONS\nThe dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from \nthe options below.

When the gelatinous cube is subjected to \npiercing damage, it can move a random creature engulfed \nby it to intercept the attack. The creature takes the piercing \ndamage as if it were the target.\nGhoul\nThis gaunt, gray humanoid wears rags and smells strongly of \nrotting flesh. It flicks a long tongue out of its mouth, sensing for \nits next warm meal.\nGhouls amass in nightmarish packs to scour the world \nfor the flesh of the dead. Though capable hunters, most \nghoul packs raid cemeteries and ancient crypts to feast on \nBlack Flag Roleplaying 112\nputrefied flesh. Forever starving for their next meal, ghouls \nnever decay nor age and may prowl the long-forgotten \nmausoleums of dead civilizations for thousands of years, \nsearching for their next morsel of flesh.\nAbyssal Creator. A demon lord with dominion \nover undead laid waste to a mortal army and saw fit to \nexperiment on the abundance of corpses. Thus were made \nthe first ghouls. The demon lord crafted these ghouls to be \nundead shock troops smart enough to follow orders but \nnot enough to question them.\nBestial Nature. Contributing to their mental \ndiminishment, ghouls have a never-ending desire to eat \nflesh. They carry none of their concerns from their former \nlives, so their clothes are reduced to rags. The animalistic \nghouls hunt in packs, sniffing the air for prey and running \non their forelimbs and legs when chasing down their \nvictims. They also proudly embrace the nauseating stench \nthey emanate after they consume and revel in their kills.\nGhoul CR 1 \nMedium Undead \nArmor Class 12\nHit Points 32\nSpeed 30 ft., climb 30 ft.\nPerception 12 Stealth 14 \nImmune charmed | Undead Resilience\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\nLanguages Common\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+1 +2 +0 −2 +2 −2\nGhoul Hunger. A disease spread by ghouls, ghoul hunger\ninstills a despicable hunger for Humanoid flesh in the \ncreature suffering it. Until the disease is cured, the infected \ncreature is poisoned. This effect can be suppressed for 1 hour \nif the infected creature consumes any amount of Humanoid \nflesh. Every 12 hours that elapse, the infected creature \nmust succeed on a DC 13 CON save or its HP maximum is \nreduced by 7 (2d6). The creature has disadvantage on this \nsave if it consumed any amount of Humanoid flesh while \ndiseased. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a \nlong rest after the disease is cured. The creature dies if this \neffect reduces its HP maximum to 0. If the infected creature \nfails two of these saves or dies while infected, it becomes a \nghoul, or a ghast if its PB is +4 or higher, in a flesh-rending \ntransformation. Only a wish spell or similarly powerful magic \ncan reverse the transformation. A creature that succeeds on \ntwo saves recovers from the disease.\nHungry Dead Nature. The ghoul doesn’t require air or sleep. \nIn addition, it must consume at least 2 pounds of raw meat \nevery 24 hours, or it loses its immunity to exhaustion and \nrisks starvation until it does so. While it has any levels of \nexhaustion from starvation, the ghoul can’t remove levels of \nexhaustion until it consumes at least 4 pounds of raw meat. \nSpider Climb. The ghoul can climb difficult surfaces, including \nupside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability \ncheck.\nUndead Resilience. The ghoul is immune to poison damage, \nto exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.\nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The ghoul makes one Bite attack and one Claws \nattack. If both attacks hit a Humanoid target, the target must \nsucceed on a DC 13 CON save or contract Ghoul Hunger \n(see the Ghoul Hunger trait). \nBite.

If the target is a creature \nother than an elf, Construct, or Undead, it must succeed on a \nDC 13 CON save or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can \nrepeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the \neffect on itself on a success.\nGoblin, Bugbear\nA hirsute, brown-furred humanoid with dark eyes and elongated \nears wields a massive, heavily spiked club.\nNamed for their unique appearance, bugbears embraced \nthe terror-inducing term. The consummate carnivores \nenjoy the crunch of bones beneath their bloody clubs.\nBullies.While bugbears prefer to hunt and battle alone, \nthey sometimes find themselves in leadership positions \nover smaller goblins. Their command is marked by bouts of \nterror, where they randomly inflict pain or humiliation on \ntheir subordinates. They don’t expect pushback from lesser \ngoblins, but they back down from the rare, coordinated \nresponse. This attitude persists when bugbears fight other \ncreatures. If assured of an easy win, they brutalize and \ntaunt their foes. However, they flee when their opponents \ndemonstrate superiority on the battlefield, unless an even \nmore powerful leader threatens their lives.\nSneaky Combatants. Owing to their cowardice, \nbugbears try to attack with the element of surprise and are \ndeadly against surprised enemies. They wait for cover of \ndarkness or choose locations where they can hide. If the \nconditions aren’t right, they coerce their subordinates to \ncreate a distraction for them.\nBugbear CR 1 \nMedium Humanoid \nArmor Class 14 (hide armor)\nHit Points 40\nSpeed 30 ft.\nPerception 10 Stealth 16\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\nLanguages Common, Goblin\n113 Chaptier 5: Monsters\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+5 +2 +1 −1 +0 −1\nBrutal.

Fortunately, a \ngoblin can find joy almost anywhere.\nCunning Over Strength. Goblin leaders are chosen for \ntheir intelligence and deviousness rather than strength at \narms. Similarly, goblins value numbers over an individual’s \nstrength, relying on each other to overwhelm powerful foes.\nNatural Spies. Many goblins parley their natural stealth \ninto careers. In urban environments, they excel in spycraft, \ninformation gathering, and thievery. In the wilderness, \ngoblins are skillful scouts, trappers, and bandits.\nDelight in Thievery. Goblin culture considers stealing a \ndelightful challenge. A goblin who can’t guard a possession \ndoesn’t deserve it. Every goblin appreciates a good robbery, \neven if they are the victim. However, this peculiarity often \nleads to friction between goblins and other peoples.\nGoblin CR 1/4\nSmall Humanoid \nArmor Class 15 (leather armor, shield)\nHit Points 12\nSpeed 30 ft.\nPerception 9 Stealth 14 \nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\nLanguages Common, Goblin\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n−1 +4 +0 +0 −1 −1\nACTIONS\nScimitar.

If the \ninitiating goblin is within 5 feet of the target, the target must \nmake a DC 12 DEX save, taking 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage \non a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful \none. For each goblin after the first that participated in the \ngang up and that is within 10 feet of the target, the damage \nincreases by 1 as arrows, knives, sharp pocket scraps, \nBlack Flag Roleplaying 114\nand similar “weapons” fly at the target from all angles. \nAfterwards, each goblin after the first that participated in the \ngang up can’t use Gang Up until it finishes a short or long \nrest.\nBONUS ACTIONS\nNimble Escape.

The chosen ally becomes the target of the \nattack instead.\nGoblin, Hobgoblin\nThe military bearing of this humanoid is evident in its stance and \nin its readied weapon. The warrior’s yellow eyes seem to watch \neverything.\nHobgoblins stand about as tall as a human, though they \nare more powerfully built. As a society, most hobgoblin \nenclaves are highly organized military communities, called \ncohorts, where members are ranked according to their \nskills and accomplishments.\nRule Bound. The militant hobgoblins live their lives \naccording to the Decrees, a complicated set of rules, laws, \nand customs. Tenets of the Decrees are so ingrained that \neven hobgoblins who leave the community to become \nadventurers continue to model their reactions and \ndecisions on its lessons.\nThe Goblin Oath. All hobgoblins are sworn to serve \ntheir cohorts from birth, raised to honor the Decrees and \ntheir superiors in equal measure. The cohort combines \nmilitary virtues with family loyalty to create a potent \nwhole. To swear by the cohort is the most binding promise \na hobgoblin can give.\nHobgoblin CR 1/2\nMedium Humanoid \nArmor Class 18 (chain mail, shield)\nHit Points 18\nSpeed 30 ft.\nPerception 10 Stealth 8 (13 without heavy armor)\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\nLanguages Common, Goblin\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+1 +1 +1 +0 +0 −1\nACTIONS\nMultiattack.

One friendly creature within 30 feet \nof the hobgoblin commander that it can see gains 7 (2d6) \ntemporary HP until the start of the commander’s next \nturn.\n• Pressing Advance. The commander moves up to half its \nspeed and commands one friendly creature it can see \nwithin 30 feet of it to also move. The target can use its \nreaction to move up to half its speed in the direction of \nthe commander’s choosing. This movement for both \ncreatures is unaffected by difficult terrain and doesn’t \nprovoke opportunity attacks.\nGrimlock\nUttering a repetitive clicking sound, a rugged, human-like \ncreature shuffles forward, cocking its head to one side as if \nlistening intently. It has gray skin, stringy hair, and large, \nsightless red eyes.\nGrimlocks descend from the human population of a vast \nempire long ago lost to the underground in some forgotten \ncalamity. Over generations, they adapted to the world \nbelow ground, gradually losing their sight and evolving \nnew senses.\nBlind Stewards. Xenophobic hunter-gatherers, \ngrimlocks retain some slight vestige of their ancestors’ \nmighty empire in the form of complicated techno\u0002arcane devices. Grimlock shamans use complicated \noral traditions to pass down knowledge of how to \nmaintain these machines, though few grimlocks know \nhow to construct them. This doesn’t stop grimlocks \nfrom pocketing baubles cast off from these devices, and \nmany grimlocks have found the baubles to be effective at \nrepelling or disorienting intruders.\nEchosense. Grimlocks speak and understand the \nlanguage of the subterranean world, though they prefer to \nspeak their own dialect of Dwarvish. The clicking sounds \nthat form most of their words also serve as a form of \necholocation.\nSensitive Hearing. Relying on hearing and scent, \ngrimlocks thrive in dark environments. However, their \nsensitive ears are particularly vulnerable to loud sounds.\nGrimlock CR 1/4 \nMedium Humanoid \nArmor Class 11\nHit Points 17\nSpeed 30 ft.\nPerception 11 Stealth 13\nVulnerable thunder | deafened\nSenses keensense 30 ft.

The grimlock chooses one of the \nfollowing objects:\n• Flashing Rock. The grimlock throws a scintillating rock at \nthe target that bursts with a myriad of colors. The target \nmust succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or be blinded until the \nend of its next turn.\n• Illusory Dancer. The grimlock throws a small disk that \nemits a blurry, fractured illusion of a graceful, humanoid \ndancer. The target must succeed on a DC 11 CHA save \nor be incapacitated until the end of its next turn as it is \nmesmerized by the dance.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 116\n• Whirling Death.

The target \nmust succeed on a DC 11 WIS save or be frightened until \nthe end of its next turn. On a success, the target realizes \nthe gear’s growth was a magical, illusory effect and that \nthe gear never increased in size.\nHarpy\nWith the body of a woman and the wings and talons of a swift \nraptor, this monstrosity slashes the air as she dives at prey. Often, \na harpy strikes with a deadly song on her lips.\nHarpies dwell in dark forests and along coastlines, \nbuilding their eyries in high places to protect their young. \nDangerous hunters with a taste for human and giant flesh, \nthey lure prey to its doom using their magical voices or \ndescend upon it with talon and claw.\nAgents of the Divine. Though loathed now, harpies \nwere once the favored messengers of the gods until some \nnow-forgotten transgression exiled them from the divine \nrealms. Harpies claim they have no stories or legends of \nthat time.\nClamor Eyries. Harpies live in large flocks of six to ten \nmated pairs and their children. A typical clamor is led by \nthe strongest hunters or most powerful singers.\nUrban Harpies. A few harpies have found acceptance \nin large urban centers. They trade their aerial speed or \nmagical songs for coins.\nHarpy CR 1 \nMedium Monstrosity\nArmor Class 13\nHit Points 38\nSpeed 20 ft., fly 40 ft.\nPerception 10 Stealth 13 \nResistant charmed | Monstrosity Resilience\nSenses darkvision 120 ft.\nLanguages Common\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+1 +3 +1 −2 +0 +1\nMonstrosity Resilience.

Every \nHumanoid and Giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can \nhear the song must succeed on a DC 11 WIS save or be \ncharmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus \naction on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can \nstop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is \nincapacitated.\nWhile charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and \nignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is \nmore than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move \non its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying \nto get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, \nbut before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a \npit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than \nthe harpy, the target can repeat the save. A charmed target \ncan also repeat the save at the end of each of its turns. If \nthe save is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that \nsuccessfully saves is immune to this harpy’s song for the next \n24 hours.\nHell Hound\nBrimstone permeates the air around this hulking canine. The \nbeast’s claws are curved daggers, its eyes shine with a burning \nradiance, and flames curl out of its fanged mouth.\nHellhounds are fiends punished by their kin and forcibly \ntransformed into the shape of a beast. They roam the \ninfernal realms in cruel packs or serve whatever masters \nthey hope will restore them to original forms.\nInfernal Guardians. Hellhounds are often encountered \nnear sites important to evil creatures or demonic \nincursions. Greater demons give mortal supplicants the \nservice of hellhounds as a reward, though it also helps the \ndemon to watch over them.\nNo Mere Beast. Despite their shape and other bestial \ninstincts, hellhounds are still fiends, and they retain most \nof their intellect and cruel cunning. Opponents who expect \nthem to act like hounds seldom discover their error before \nthey are consumed. They prefer to fight in great numbers, \nand when they begin a hunt, very little dissuades them.\nHell Hound CR 3\nMedium Fiend (Outsider)\nArmor Class 15 (natural armor)\nHit Points 76\nSpeed 50 ft.\nPerception 15 Stealth 11\nImmune fire | charmed, frightened\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\nLanguages understands Infernal but can’t speak\n117 Chaptier 5: Monsters\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+5 +1 +2 −2 +3 −2\nPack Tactics.

They are omnivorous but \nprefer meat. A single hippogriff considers an extremely \nwide swath as its hunting territory and remains in an area \nuntil the food supply is exhausted.\nEternal Mates. Hippogriffs mate for life, raising one to \ntwo young at a time. They lay eggs, taking turns watching \nover them (or hatchlings) while the other mate hunts for \nfood. When a hippogriff dies, its mate often starves itself \nto death.\nLoyal Steeds. Hippogriff eggs are prized treasures and \nvaluable to everyone from elven lords to powerful human \ngenerals. A single egg is valued at 2,000 gp. Of all the \nmonstrous mounts, hippogriffs are the easiest to train. \nHowever, the death of a hippogriff ’s rider sends the mount \ninto a frenzy.\nHippogriff CR 1 \nLarge Monstrosity (Animal)\nArmor Class 11\nHit Points 44 \nSpeed 40 ft., fly 60 ft.\nPerception 13 Stealth 10 \nResistant Monstrosity Resilience\nSenses —\nLanguages —\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+3 +1 +1 −4 +3 −1\nHeightened Sight.

They have red \neyes and reptilian tails, and though only the size of gnomes, they \nhold their weapons with easy familiarity.\nKobolds are diligent, hardworking creatures who view life \nthrough a practical lens. They instinctively conform to the \nwishes of anyone stronger than themselves rather than risk \nconfrontation. Kobolds can be found in dark forests, deep \nunderground, and in the heart of urban centers.\nClever Miners. Skilled miners and inordinately clever \nwith mechanical devices, kobolds routinely surround their \nwarrens with traps, deadfalls, and camouflage.\nCollective Community. Kobolds share a strong \ncommunal instinct, knowing that only by acting together \ncan they hope to defeat threats against them. When \nkobolds travel with other lineages, they extend this spirit to \ntheir companions.\nTalented Witches and Alchemists.

Then another eye opens, and another still. With \nstartling speed, the barrel becomes a pseudopod-wielding horror, \nits toothy maw opening wide.\nThe dungeon delver’s bane, a mimic is a stealthy predator \nthat transforms itself into an inanimate object, perfectly \ncopying the appearance of wood or stone. It typically poses \nas furniture, doors, stairs, and the like. In its natural form, \nit resembles an amorphous blob with flesh-like protrusions \nresembling objects it previously copied.\nDeceptive Hunters.While not terribly intelligent, mimics \nare uncanny predators. They lurk in well trafficked areas of \ndungeons, wildernesses, or urban environments, assuming \nshapes intended to lure prey. They then use their sticky \nadhesive skin to trap their next meal.\nTaste Focused. Mimics are supremely patient, but they \nare obsessed with consuming prey to relish the taste, not \nnecessarily to sate hunger. The taste buds of a mimic’s \ntongue are extremely sensitive, and they gather a great deal \nof information with every bite.\nMimic CR 2\nMedium Monstrosity (Shapechanger)\nArmor Class 12 (natural armor)\nHit Points 58\nSpeed 20 ft.\nPerception 11 Stealth 13 \nVulnerable cold\nResistant grappled | Monstrosity Resilience\nImmune acid | prone\nSenses keensense 60 ft.\nLanguages —\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+3 +1 +2 −3 +1 −1\nAdhesive (Object Form Only).

While the mimic \nremains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary \nobject.\nGrappler. The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any \ncreature grappled by it.\nMonstrosity Resilience. The mimic is resistant to exhaustion \nand to the frightened condition. \nACTIONS\nMultiattack. The mimic makes two Pseudopod attacks. If it \nis grappling a creature, it can replace one attack with a Bite \nattack.\nBite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled \ncreature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid \ndamage.\nPseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one \ntarget. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the mimic is \nin object form, the target is subjected to its Adhesive trait. \nBONUS ACTIONS\nChange Shape. The mimic transforms into a Large or smaller \nobject or back into its true, amorphous form, which is a \nMonstrosity. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any \nequipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It \nreverts to its true form if it dies.\nREACTIONS\nPrey Shield. When a creature the mimic can see hits it with an \nattack while it is grappling a creature, the mimic can roll the \ngrappled creature in front of the blow, forcing the grappled \ncreature to take the damage instead.\nMycolid\nThis small living fungus has the white fibrous stalk and soft, \nspongy head of a mushroom. Beneath its wide, bell-shaped cap, \nhumanoid arms clutch ramshackle gardening instruments and \ncrude weapons, while flat leg-stalks move the plant-creature \ntoward any potential threats.\nMycolids sprout in areas infused with unnatural magical \nenergy, such as the fetid bog of a black dragon, the \ncavernous ruins of the underworld, or the shady glade \nblessed by an archfey or druid. Regardless of region or \n119 Chaptier 5: Monsters\nclimate, commoner myconids spend most of their lives \ncultivating a huge variety of mushrooms into a single \nunbroken chain of interconnected growth.\nCommunity First. They thrive in harsh environments \nwithout thought for shelter, culture, art, or history, and \ninstead pour every moment of their relatively short lives \ninto expanding the colony. Few creatures attack the \npeaceful fungal folk, but those that do find their woody \nbodies, soft, springy heads, and immunity to pain difficult\nto overcome. When a colony is threatened, every commoner \nmycolid fights to the death to protect the collective.\nHighly Toxic. Though commoner mycolids are safe to \nhandle, creatures foolish enough to eat one may succumb to \ntheir potent toxins. In extreme situations, mycolids may let \nthemselves be eaten to kill massive or dangerous creatures \nand add fertilizer to the colony. Mycolids spores are a \npowerful defense mechanism as well, and older mycolids \nhave more powerful spores. Even newborn commoner \nmycolid spores can addle the mind of most beasts.\nShared Memory. Each mycolid is a clone of a single \nprogenitor called a spore lord. A family of like mycolids, \nthe spawn of an individual spore lord, is called a “ring,” \nand each ring shares a collective pool of memories and \nconsciousness connected to a mycelial network. As such, \nmycolids remember their own births as though they tended \nto their younger selves personally and can recall every birth \nand death since the ring began. Though all members of a \nring look identical, no two rings are exactly alike. Separate \nrings cannot share thoughts or memories, but all mycolids \ncan communicate telepathically over short distances.\nSpore Lord. When a safe area of rich, damp fertilizer \ncan be secured, a commoner mycolid may undergo a \nrapid change into a more powerful form capable of using \nits spores to create a near-endless supply of identical \noffspring. This form, called a spore lord, does not rule over \nother mycolids. But while commoners tend to the health of \nmushrooms and mycolid sprouts, spore lords protect the \ncolony from threats and supply it with a stream of clones. \nA single spore lord might create dozens or hundreds of \nclones of itself in its lifetime, and a dozen spore lords from \ndifferent colonies may amass in a single fertile location \nwithout conflict.\nMagic Channelers. Upon transformation, a spore lord \nis made larger, stronger, and smarter by the primal magic \nthat spawned it. Spore lords instinctively know how to \nmanipulate the environment through cultivation and \nmagic.\nCommunal Knowledge. All members of a spore lord’s \nring share its memories, but commoners lack the capacity \nto understand how and why the spore lord is different, \nthough they recognize it. Only when separated from the \ncolony can a commoner reach such an understanding, \nusually moments before it changes into a spore lord itself.\nMycolid Commoner CR 1/2\nSmall Plant\nArmor Class 12\nHit Points 22\nSpeed 15 ft.\nPerception 13 Stealth 14 \nResistant poison | Plant Resilience\nSenses keensense 120 ft.

The spore lord causes \nfungal growth to erupt from a point on the ground it can \nsense within 120 feet of it. A ring of mushrooms sprouts in \na 15-foot radius around that point. Each creature that isn’t \na mycolid within that ring must make a DC 14 CON save, \ntaking 13 (3d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as \nmuch damage on a successful one.

Aggressive, opportunistic warriors, orcs \nfollow the rule of might. In orcish culture, you are entitled \nto whatever you can take, for however long you are strong \nenough to hold it. Tribes choose homes based on the other \ncreatures that live nearby and what they have worth taking, \neven if those others are another orc tribe.\nGreat War Banners.

An owlbear has the shape and mass of a grizzly \nbear, with a thick coat of fur intermixed with feathers. \nThe massive body is topped with a great, owl-like head, \ncomplete with large, round eyes and a curved, hooked beak \nthat can grip and tear its prey. Though incapable of flight, \nthe owlbear’s limbs are covered with enough feathers for \ngliding when it leaps from sufficiently high cliffs and hills.\nTerritorial. Territorial and testy, owlbears are quick to \nchallenge interlopers in their domain. An owlbear faces \nlarger or more numerous opponents with undaunted \nsavagery that often scares off larger and even more \npowerful foes.\nNesting. Normally solitary, owlbears remain together \nonly to rear their hatchlings until they are old enough \nto fend for themselves. Mated pairs sometimes build an \nenormous stick-nest in a cavern or on a rocky spire. An \nangry owlbear defending its eggs or young is especially \ndangerous.\nTribal Guardians.

Its vast, toothy maw is large \nenough to swallow a horse whole.\nTruly the rulers of their domains, purple worms claim the \nUnderworld as their hunting grounds. These tremendous \nmonsters can bore through solid rock, creating new \ntunnels and passageways as they travel. Any creature a \npurple worm encounters besides another of its kind is prey.\nFollow Prey by Sound. Purple worms are attracted \nby sound and vibration, leading most subterranean \nhumanoids to travel as quietly as possible and ensure that \nbattles are short and decisive. Major settlements in the \nUnderworld have contingencies in place for a purple worm \nattack.\nGemstones and Ore. A purple worm digests the earth \nand rock it ingests while tunneling, excreting it along \nthe tunnels it creates and in the caverns where it rests.

Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. \nHit: 22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a Large \nor smaller creature, it must make a DC 19 DEX save or be \nswallowed by the purple worm. A swallowed creature is \nblinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and \nother effects outside of the worm, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid \ndamage at the start of each of the worm’s turns. \n If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn \nfrom a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 \nCON save at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed \ncreatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the \nworm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer \nrestrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 \nfeet of movement, exiting prone.\nTail Stinger. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., \none creature. Hit: 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the \ntarget must make a DC 19 CON save, taking 42 (12d6) poison \ndamage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a \nsuccessful one.\nThrash (Recharge 5–6).

On a success, a \ncreature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.\nBONUS ACTIONS\nRapid Digestion. The purple worm’s digestive system absorbs \nsome of the already digested material from creatures it has \nswallowed. If the purple worm has at least one swallowed \ncreature inside it, the purple worm regains 9 (2d8) HP. This \nhealing increases by 4 (1d8) for each creature currently inside \nthe purple worm, to a maximum of 10d8.\nRust Monster\nA strange, insectile creature skitters forward on four legs. It \nwaves two large, feathery antennae about in a questing manner.\nAs its name implies, this odd creature can rust ferrous \nmetals, allowing it to eat the oxidized results. The rust \nmonster roams caves and tunnels seeking out such metals. \nWhen it finds it, the creature aggressively rushes to devour \nthe meal. Because rust monsters have a basic, animalistic \nintelligence, an adventurer can save their sword or shield \nby distracting the creature with another source of metal.\nArmored Shell. A rust monster is about the size of a large \ndog. It has an insectile appearance, with armored plates \nlike an exoskeleton. It has segmented legs but, unlike an \ninsect, only four of them. It has a thin, whip-like tail that \nthrashes when the creature is agitated or catches the scent \nof metals.\nColor Matches Diet. The coloration of its hide varies \ndepending on its diet. A rust monster whose diet includes \nlarge amounts of mithral would have a silvery sheen to its \nhide, for example.\nRust Monster CR 1/2\nMedium Monstrosity\nArmor Class 14 (natural armor)\nHit Points 25\nSpeed 40 ft.\nBlack Flag Roleplaying 124\nPerception 11 Stealth 13 \nResistant Monstrosity Resilience\nSenses darkvision 60 ft., tremorsense 30 ft.\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+1 +1 +1 −4 +1 −2\nIron Scent.

Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. \nHit: 8 (2d6 + 1) piercing damage.\nAntennae. The rust monster corrodes a nonmagical ferrous \nmetal object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn’t \nbeing worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube \nof it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, \nthe creature can make a DC 11 DEX save to avoid the rust \nmonster’s touch.\n If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal \nshield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and \ncumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers.

If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it \nrusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.\nSkeleton\nHalf hidden in darkness, skeletal bones clad in rusted armor and \nrotten clothing lurch toward you. The thing’s bony hands grip a \nsword with malign intent.\nSkeletons are fleshless undead that have been \nreconstructed and animated by fell magic. Soulless, \nemotionless, and driven by the whims of their master, the \nskeleton is an unshakable guardian. Skeletons can be found \nin desecrated temples, graveyards, and cemeteries where \nthey can watch, completely motionless, for eons. New and \nmasterful necromancers use skeletons as stalwart guards \nand servants, though they understand such creatures have \nno loyalty beyond the magic that controls them.\nDark Intelligence. While lacking humanoid intelligence, \nskeletons possess a cleverness that extends beyond a mere \nbeast or construct. Their malicious minds remember how to \nwield weapons and armor, and they collect and use weapons \nor shields taken from the recent dead. Skeletons look upon \nthe living with eyeless sockets and unsettling patience as \ntheir instincts judge distances, tactics, and methods to \nseparate a potential target’s flesh from their bones.\nMoldering Bodies. Though dried strands of tendon or \nwisps of stubborn hair may cling to a skeleton, magic alone \nis responsible for its movement. Piercing weapons and \narrows may skip from the skeleton’s hardened bone, but \nheavy blows shatter them.\nSkeleton CR 1/4 \nMedium Undead \nArmor Class 13 (armor scraps)\nHit Points 14\nSpeed 30 ft.\nPerception 9 Stealth 14\nVulnerable bludgeoning\nResistant piercing \nImmune Undead Resilience\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\nLanguages understands all languages it knew in life but \ncan’t speak\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+0 +2 +2 −2 −1 −3\nFalse Appearance.

Humanoids can be infected by the fungus \nthrough contaminated food or water, breathing the spore \nclouds, or the bite of an infected host.\nStages of Infection. Creatures infected by the apocalyptic \nfungus go through different stages of infection before \nthey ultimately expire. Most die before reaching the final \nstage, though the fungus in their bodies continues to grow, \ndissolving the host’s remains. If the host body sustains \nserious damage or can no longer move easily, the fungus \nattempts to move into a dark, sheltered area so that, as \nthe body decays, the fungus fruits and releases its spores. \nSunlight kills the fungus and its spores.\nSkullblooms. Infected humanoids that succumb to the \nfungus become sporeborn skullblooms. Skullblooms \nshow physical signs of their transformation, as the spores \ninside the host’s brain sprout into spongy stalks that \nbreak through the skull to crown the head, while patches \nof fungus break through the cheeks and around the eye \nsockets and random areas of the body. Skullblooms stalk \nor ambush victims and use cooperative tactics, such as \nherding potential victims toward other skullblooms lying \nin wait. Sometimes skullblooms enter periods of inertia, \nlying down or leaning up against a wall or tree and allowing \nthe fungus to spread over them, only to burst out and \nattack when a potential target passes by.\nBloatblossoms. Skullblooms eventually grow into \nbloatblossoms. A riot of fungal growth makes the body of \nthese sporeborn broad and ungainly, with layers of tough, \nfibrous growth that protect it from damage. Bloatblossoms \nhave better echolocation than the younger skullblooms, as \nwell as nodules filled with mycotoxins that they can tear \nfrom their bodies and hurl at targets.\nSkullbloom CR 1/2 \nMedium Plant\nArmor Class 11 (natural armor)\nHit Points 23\nSpeed 30 ft.\nPerception 11 Stealth 12 \nResistant Plant Resilience\nSenses keensense 10 ft.\nLanguages understands the languages it knew in life but \ncan’t speak\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+2 +0 +2 −4 −1 −3\nHeightened Hearing.

A tiny humanoid, \nheld aloft on dragonfly wings, appears as though from thin air.\nSprites are diminutive fey that protect the deepest \nforests and the holiest glades. Attentive and well trained \nin guerrilla tactics, sprites are among the most aggressive \nand loyal fey. They may appear to travelers and parlay, \nuncovering interlopers’ intentions with their Heart Sight \nand acting against those whose intentions are suspect.\nUnseen Warriors. Sprites travel through the forest in \nbands of six to one hundred. They mask their numbers \nusing their diminutive size and natural ability to turn \ninvisible. Though sprites have been known to turn would-be \ntrespassers away from their forest homes with traps, noises, \nor theatrical distractions, they are armed with arrows that \ncan put creatures into a deep sleep. While their quarry \nsleeps, they may fetch a far more dangerous threat, retreat, \nor signal for reinforcements to dissuade further hostility.\nStern Protectors. Unlike many fey, sprites are serious, \neven-tempered, and intent on doing as little harm as \npossible. Those they judge worthy might find themselves \nprotected within the sprites’ territory, while those found \nwanting could walk headlong into ambushes, traps, and \nenraged beasts. Sprites refrain from tricks and mischief but \nsuffer no evil within their domains.\nSprite CR 1/4 \nTiny Fey \nArmor Class 14 (leather armor)\nHit Points 13\nSpeed 10 ft., fly 40 ft.\nPerception 11 Stealth 17\nResistant Fey Resilience\nSenses —\nLanguages Common, Elvish, Sylvan\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n−4 +3 +0 +2 +1 +0\nFey Resilience.

If the save fails by 5 or more, the poisoned \ntarget falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it \nAPOCALYPTICFUNGUS\nDisease\nAn infectious disease transmitted via fungal spores. \nInfected creatures become irritable and sensitive to noise. \nIn the final stages, fibrous fungal growths sprout from the \nskin—particularly around the cranium. If left untreated, \ninfected creatures turn into sporeborn skullblooms. \nTrigger: A humanoid that ingests food or water \ncontaminated with the spores of the apocalyptic fungus, \nbreathes in the spores, or is bitten by an infected creature \nmust make a DC 12 CON save or become infected. \nEffects: An infected target can’t regain hit points and \nwhen it finishes a long rest must make a DC 15 CON \nsave or gain two levels of exhaustion. When the infected \ntarget reaches the sixth level of exhaustion, it does \nnot die but instead becomes a skullbloom, at which \npoint no mundane or magical healing can return the \ncreature to its former state. If a humanoid infected with \napocalyptic fungal spores is killed, it rises an hour later as \na skullbloom.\nResolution: Pre-transformation, the fungal infection can \nonly be cured by the lesser restoration spell or similar \nmagic.\n127 Chaptier 5: Monsters\ntakes damage or another creature takes an action to shake \nit awake.\nInvisibility. The sprite magically turns invisible until it \nattacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if \nconcentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or \ncarries is invisible with it.\nBONUS ACTIONS\nHeart Sight. The sprite touches a creature and magically \nknows the creature’s current emotional state. If the target \nfails a DC 13 CHA save, the sprite also knows if the creature \nhas malign intentions or intends to commit malevolent \nacts within the next hour. Celestials, Fiends, and Undead \nautomatically fail the save.\nSwift Flight. The sprite moves up to half its speed without \nprovoking opportunity attacks.\nStar Crow\nA tiny, pulsing mote weaves through the night. As it approaches, \nits phosphorescent glow slowly dims into blackness. Seconds later, \nthe thing erupts with a blinding flash.\nStar crows are tiny, formless alien beings that lack \nsentience or emotion. These glowing creatures are drawn \nto sentient beings, feeding ravenously on the beings’ \nthoughts. They have also been known to carry and transfer \nmemories of one sentient creature to another. Star crows \ntransmit these thoughts as a powerful illusory experience, \na pastiche of raw emotion, color, images, and sounds. \nSome star crows bear the wisdom of primordial beings, \nwhile others deliver incomprehensible knowledge.\nImmortal. Star crows have an infinite lifespan. They do \nnot age and do not require food, water, air, or rest. The \nmemories each star crow carries degrade, combine, or \ninterlace with the eons of visions a single star crow may \npossess. A star crow reproduces by splitting, making a \nperfect copy of itself, when it acquires too many memories \nto handle without corruption. A newly spawned star crow \nassumes about a fourth of the information, lessening the \nburden of its parent.\nStar Crow CR 1/4 \nTiny Aberration\nArmor Class 15 (natural armor)\nHit Points 12\nSpeed 20 ft., fly 60 ft.

Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) radiant damage, and the star \ncrow attaches to the target. While attached, the star crow \ncan use only the Thought Share action and Blinding Burst \nbonus action, and it moves with the target whenever the \ntarget moves, requiring none of the star crow’s movement. \nThe star crow can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its \nmovement. A creature, including the target, can take its \naction to detach the star crow by succeeding on a DC 13 STR \ncheck.\nThought Share. The star crow learns some of the attached \ntarget’s memories, and the attached target experiences a \nrapid sequence of memories from other creatures the star \ncrow has encountered. The target takes 5 (2d4) psychic \ndamage and must succeed on a DC 13 CHA save or be \nstunned until the end of its next turn.\nBONUS ACTIONS\nBlinding Burst (Recharge 5–6). The star crow dims then \nsuddenly bursts with blinding light. Each creature within 30 \nfeet of the star crow must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or \nbe blinded until the end of its next turn.\nTroll\nThis hunched giant stares hungrily with wide eyes. Baring \nmassive fangs, it reaches out with long, hooked claws.\nTrolls stand about 15 feet tall, seeming shorter due to \ntheir bowed legs and stooped postures. Long arms end in \nwicked, curved claws that scrape the ground when the troll \nmoves. Powerful, fang-filled jaws sit below long, broad \nnoses and massive, bloodshot eyes.\nVariable Appearance. Troll appearance varies widely, \nand they are prone to a variety of cosmetic mutations. Skin \ntones and body types include scaled or slimy, broad and \nrangy, and even somewhat twiggy or stonelike in some \ncases. Some sport shaggy mops of hair and even beards, \nwhile others are completely hairless.\nBullies. Trolls are natural bullies, killing to sate their \nappetites. They enjoy extorting food and wealth from \nweaker creatures through threats of violence.\nRegeneration. The troll’s most notable feature is its \npowerful regenerative capabilities. Given time, a troll \nBlack Flag Roleplaying 128\ncan recover from nearly any wound, even complete \ndismemberment or beheading.

The \ntroll then regains HP equal to half the damage dealt.\nWorg\nA canine as large as a horse bears down, its oily muzzle caked \nin blood and saliva. Its thick, heavy shoulders and massive neck \nsway side to side, and with each step, its long, mangy tail drags \nalong behind it.\nAn enormous creature resembling a wolf, worgs are \nnightmarish hunters with a taste for humanoid flesh. They \nwillingly stalk inhospitable terrain in their endless hunt \nfor their next meal, roaming snow fields, volcanic barrens, \neven stony badlands. Known to collect grisly bounties and \nto coat their bodies with fetid remains, worgs are more \nferocious than any natural beast.\nWarren Dweller. Worgs often shelter in warrens, \ntunnels, and caves in which they can travel quickly to prey \nand away from predators. Such places are fetid, vile places \nfull of half-eaten corpses that the worg seems to have \ngorged itself on without consequence.\nWilling Mounts. While many beasts of burden must \nbe trained to hold a rider, worgs tend to willingly carry \ngoblins, who share a great number of similarities to the \nworg, and use the smaller creatures to find more bountiful \nhumanoid prey. Possessing surprising intelligence, worgs \nhave learned to speak Goblin as well as their own guttural \nlanguage. On rare occasions, worgs have even learned to \nspeak and understand Common or Elvish.\nWorg CR 1/2\nLarge Monstrosity (Animal)\nArmor Class 13 (natural armor)\nHit Points 25\nSpeed 30 ft.\nPerception 14 Stealth 13 \nResistant Monstrosity Resilience\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\nLanguages Goblin, Worg\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+3 +1 +1 −2 +0 −1\nHeightened Hearing and Smell.

The worg unleashes an unnatural \nhowl audible out to a distance of 300 feet. Each creature of \nthe worg’s choice within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC \n13 CHA save or be frightened of it for 1 minute. A frightened \ncreature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, \nending the effect on itself on a success. Until it finishes a \nlong rest, the worg can sense the direction but not the exact \nlocation of each creature that was frightened by Loathsome \nHowl.\n129 Chaptier 5: Monsters\nZombie\nA rotting corpse shambles forward, arms outstretched and \nflailing.\nZombies are the animated corpses of the dead, brought \nto unlife by necromantic magic, creating tireless, fearless \nservants that obey without hesitation. Occasionally, \nzombies are produced by other methods. Victims of wights, \nfor example, often rise as zombies under command of the \nundead that killed them. Sometimes an enduring source \nof necromantic magic corrupts an area, causing nearby \ncorpses to spontaneously rise as zombies.\nDecayed Corpses. The appearance of zombies varies \nwidely, depending upon the condition of the corpse prior \nto animation. A corpse dead from natural causes and stolen \nfrom an undertaker may be well-preserved, if obviously not \nalive, while a zombie animated from a drowning victim is \nbloated and sagging. Some necromancers use whatever is \nat hand. Others may choose the most disgusting corpses \nto add an additional fear factor for those that must face the \nzombies in combat.\nDim Intellect. Zombies have no personality and little \nintellect, following only the most basic commands. They \ncan wield weapons if armed but simply batter an opponent \nwith its limbs if not. They do not have the intellect to avoid \neven obvious hazards, shambling into open pits if they exist \nbetween them and a target or walking heedlessly through \na fire to attack, unless commanded otherwise in that \nmoment. When not under specific orders, a zombie simply \nstands awaiting commands, though if a living creature \ncomes close enough for it to detect, it attacks, as the dark \nmagics animating a zombie make it malicious toward the \nliving.\nNon-Human Zombies. Zombies are most commonly \nanimated human remains, but the flesh of any living thing \ncan be animated as a zombie. Zombie giants, for example, \nwould be stronger and harder to kill than a human zombie. \nThey would attack like other zombies, though they could \nthrow rocks like a living giant if commanded to do so. Non\u0002humanoid zombies typically attack as they did when living. \nA zombie dragon, for example, would attack with claws \nand teeth, and it could still fly if its wings were intact.\nZombie CR 1/4 \nMedium Undead\nArmor Class 8\nHit Points 16\nSpeed 20 ft.\nPerception 10 Stealth 8 \nImmune Undead Resilience\nSenses darkvision 60 ft.\nLanguages understands the languages it knew in life but \ncan’t speak\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n+2 −2 +3 −4 +0 −3\nUndead Fortitude.

This disease is passed through the bites \nof infected rats, but rats are immune to the disease’s \neffects. Until the disease is cured, the creature is \npoisoned and can’t regain HP except by magical means. \nEvery 24 hours that elapse, the infected creature must \nrepeat the save (using the DC of the infecting rat’s \nBite), reducing its HP maximum by 3 (1d6) on a failure. \nThe disease is cured on a success.

        "CombatA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting.  e game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a ba le takes a turn.  e order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when all participants PCs and monsters alike roll initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\n\nSURPRISE\nA band of adventurers quietly sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to a ack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until it engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the ba le gains surprise over the other. e GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the DEX (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the Perception score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn t notice a threat has the surprised condition at the start of the encounter.If you re surprised, you can t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren t.\n\nINITIATIVE\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat.  en combat starts, every participant makes a DEX check to determine their place in the initiative order.  e GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time. e GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest DEX check result to the one with the lowest.  is is called initiative order, and the GM follows it to determine when each participant acts during each round. Initiative order remains the same from round to round.If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.  e GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.Black Flag Roleplaying38\n\nYOUR TURN\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed  sometimes called your walking speed is noted on your character sheet. e most common actions you can take are described in the Actions in Combat section in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action. e Movement and Position section in this chapter gives more detailed rules for your move.You don t have to move, take an action, or do anything at all on your turn. If you can t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in Actions in Combat.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action.  e Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a class feature, spell, or other special ability states that you can do something as a bonus action. Otherwise, you don t have a bonus action to take.You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action s timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to take an action also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\n\nREACTIONS\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger, which can occur on your turn or on someone else s.  e opportunity a ack is the most common type of reaction. en you take a reaction, you can t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature s turn, that creature can continue its turn right a er the reaction.\n\n\u000eOTHER ACTIVITY ON YOUR TURN\nYour turn can include a variety of minor flourishes that don t require your action or your move. Some pointers:   You can communicate at any time through brief talking and gestures.   You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move, or you could draw your weapon as part of your A ack action.   If you want to interact with a second object, you need to commit your action to it.   Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions. e GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\n\nMOVEMENT AND POSITION\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, o en using movement and position to gain the upper hand.On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as li le of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming.  ese different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can be your entire move. However you move, deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\n\nBREAKING UP YOUR MOVE\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some speed before and then the remainder a er your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.39 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n\nCOMBAT STEP BY STEP\n1. Determine surprise.

For example, a fighter who can make two a acks with the Multia ack feature and has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an a ack, move 15 feet, and then a ack a different target.\n\nUSING DIFFERENT SPEEDS\nIf you have more than one speed, such as a walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between them during your move.  enever you switch, subtract the distance you ve already moved from the new speed.  e result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can t use the new speed during the current move.For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet. If you wanted to walk any farther, you d be done for your move, but you could still leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\n\nDIFFICULT TERRAIN\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases the se ing of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot.  is rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain.  e space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.\n\nBEING PRONE\nCombatants o en find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in the Appendix.You can drop prone freely, without using any speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can t stand up if you don t have enough movement le  or if your speed is 0.To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\n\n\u000eMOVING AROUND OTHER CREATURES\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature s space. You can only move through a hostile creature s space if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature s space is difficult terrain for you. ether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can t willingly end your move in its space.If you leave a hostile creature s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity a ack.\n\nFLYING MOVEMENT\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held alo  by magic, such as by the fly spell.\n\nCREATURE SIZE\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space.  e Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat.Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\n\nSIZE CATEGORIES\n\n\nSIZE SPACE\nTiny 2½ by 2½ ft. Small                5 by 5 ft.Medium 5 by 5 ft. Large                10 by 10 ft. Huge 15 by 15 ft. Gargantuan           20 by 20 ft. or larger\n\nSPACE\nA space is the area in feet that a creature effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn t 5 feet wide, for example, but in a fight, it controls that space. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.A creature s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there s li le room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.Black Flag Roleplaying40\n\nSQUEEZING INTO A SMALLER SPACE\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it.  us, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that s only 5 feet wide.  ile squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on a ack rolls and DEX saves. A ack rolls against the creature have advantage while it s squeezing.\n\nACTIONS IN COMBAT\n en you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have their own distinct actions in their stat blocks. en you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\n\nATTACK\n e most common action in combat is the A ack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.With this action, you make one melee or ranged a ack. See the Making an A ack section later in this chapter for rules that govern a acks.Certain features, such as the fighter s Multia ack, allow you to make more than one a ack with this action.\n\nCAST A SPELL\nSpellcasting characters, such as clerics and wizards, and some monsters can take the Cast a Spell action to cast a spell in combat. You can only cast spells this way if the spell has a casting time of 1 action. If a spell s casting time is longer than an action (minutes or hours) or a reaction, you can t take this action to cast it.\n\nDASH\n en you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn.  e increase equals your speed, a er applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn with a Dash.\n\nDISENGAGE\n en you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn t provoke opportunity a acks for the rest of the turn.\n\n\u000eDODGE\n en you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding a acks. Until the start of your next turn, you make DEX saves with advantage and a ack rolls made against you have disadvantage if you can see the a acker. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in the Appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.\n\nHELP\n en you take the Help action, you lend aid to another creature to complete a task.  at creature gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.You can also take the Help action to aid a friendly creature a ack a target within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or otherwise team up to make your ally s a ack more effective. If your ally a acks the target before your next turn, they get advantage on their first a ack roll.\n\nHIDE\n en you take the Hide action, you make a DEX (Stealth) check in an a empt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the Unseen A ackers and Targets section in this chapter.\n\nREADY\n en you take the Ready action, you prepare to do something on another creature s turn using your reaction.  is lets you get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. You must take your readied reaction before the start of your next turn.First, name a perceivable circumstance that triggers your reaction.  en, state the action or move you will take in response to that trigger. Examples include,  If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I ll pull the lever that opens it,  and  If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.  en the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right a er the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.You can ready a spell with the Ready action. You cast it as normal but hold its energy.  en, a er the trigger, you release it with your reaction. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding the energy requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends. Furthermore, if you take damage before you release the readied magic missile, your concentration might be broken.41 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n\nSEARCH\n en you take the Search action, you devote your a ention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a WIS (Perception) check or an INT (Investigation) check.\n\nUSE AN OBJECT\n en you take the Use an Object action, you focus specifically on that interaction. Since you can normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as drawing a sword as part of an a ack, this action is usually only needed when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn. If an object is complex or requires an ability check to use, the GM might require this action even if it s the only object you ve handled this turn.\n\nMAKING AN ATTACK\n ether you re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an a ack roll as part of a spell, an a ack has a simple structure.1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your a ack s range: a creature, an object, or a location.2. Determine modifiers.  e GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your a ack roll.3. Resolve the a ack. You make the a ack roll. On a hit, you roll damage unless the particular a ack has rules that specify otherwise. Some a acks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.If there s ever any question whether something you re doing counts as an a ack, the rule is simple: if you re making an a ack roll, you re making an a ack.\n\nATTACK ROLLS\n en you make an a ack, your a ack roll determines whether the a ack hits or misses. To make an a ack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the check result equals or exceeds the target s AC, the a ack hits. ( e AC for an NPC or monster is in its stat block.)\n\nMODIFIERS TO THE ROLL\n en a PC makes an a ack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character s PB.  en a monster makes an a ack roll, it uses the modifier provided for the action in its stat block.Ability Modifier.  e ability modifier for a melee weapon a ack is STR, and the ability modifier for a ranged weapon a ack is DEX. Weapons with the finesse or thrown property break this rule; see weapon property descriptions in chapter 3 for more on that.Some spells also require an a ack roll.  e ability \u000emodifier used for a spell a ack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.Proficiency Bonus. Add your proficiency bonus to your a ack roll when you a ack using a weapon with which you have proficiency and any time you a ack with a spell.\n\nROLLING 1 OR 20\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.If the d20 roll for an a ack is a 20, the a ack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target s AC.  is is called a critical hit. See Critical Hits later in the chapter for more on this.If the d20 roll for an a ack is a 1, the a ack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target s AC.\n\nUNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS\nCombatants can try to escape notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness. en you a ack a target you can t see, you have disadvantage on the a ack roll.  is is true whether you re guessing at the target s location or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, though the GM might just say that you missed, not whether you guessed the target s location correctly. en a creature can t see you, you have advantage on a ack rolls against it. If you are hidden both unseen and unheard when you make an a ack, you give away your location when the a ack hits or misses.\n\nCOVER\nWalls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target benefits from cover only when an a ack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. ere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective cover applies. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and DEX saves. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body.  e obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and DEX saves. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle.  e obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.A target with total cover can t be targeted directly by an a ack or a spell, although some spells can reach a target with total cover by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.Black Flag Roleplaying42\n\nRANGED ATTACKS\n en you make a ranged a ack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged a ack.\n\nRANGE\nYou can make ranged a acks only against targets within a specified range.If a ranged a ack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can t a ack a target beyond this range.Some ranged a acks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges.  e smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your a ack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can t a ack a target beyond the long range.\n\nRANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT\nAiming a ranged a ack is more difficult when a foe is next to you.  en you make a ranged a ack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the a ack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn t incapacitated.\n\nMELEE ATTACKS\nA melee a ack allows you to a ack a foe within your reach. A melee a ack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee a ack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee a ack.Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus a ack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee a ack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee a acks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon a ack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-bu , or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your STR modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\n\nOPPORTUNITY ATTACKS\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who flees or passes by. Such a strike is called an opportunity a ack.You can make an opportunity a ack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity a ack, use your reaction to make one melee a ack against the provoking creature.  e a ack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\u000eYou can avoid provoking an opportunity a ack by taking the Disengage action. You also don t provoke an opportunity a ack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don t provoke an opportunity a ack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\n\nTWO-WEAPON FIGHTING\n en you take the A ack action and a ack with a light melee weapon held in one hand, you can use a bonus action to a ack with a different light melee weapon you hold in the other hand. You don t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus a ack, unless that modifier is negative.If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon instead of making a melee a ack with it.\n\nGRAPPLING\nUsing the A ack action, you can make a special melee a ack to grapple a creature. If you can make multiple a acks with the A ack action, this a ack replaces one of them. e target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an a ack roll: a STR (Athletics) check contested by the target s STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses which check to use). If you win the contest, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see Appendix).  e condition specifies what ends it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. It must succeed on a STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check contested by your STR (Athletics) check.Moving a Grappled Creature.  en you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\n\nSHOVING\nUsing the A ack action, you can make a special melee a ack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you can make multiple a acks with the A ack action, this a ack replaces one of them. e target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an a ack roll, you make a STR (Athletics) check contested by the target s STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses which check to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.43 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n\nDAMAGE AND HEALING\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds.  e thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\n\nHIT POINTS\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill.  ose with fewer hit points are more fragile.A creature s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from its hit point maximum down to 0.  is number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing. enever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points.  e loss of hit points has no effect on a creature s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\n\nTEMPORARY HIT POINTS\nSome spells and special abilities give you temporary hit points. Don t add these to your current hit points. Instead, think of them as a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protects you from injury. en you have temporary hit points and take damage, lose the temporary hit points first. Any le over damage carries over to your current hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.Because temporary hit points are separate from your current hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. You can be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.Healing can t restore temporary hit points, and you can t stack temporary hit points together. If you have a pool of temporary hit points and then get more from another source, decide whether to keep the ones you have or take the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.  ey can still absorb damage directed at you while you re unconscious, but only true healing can stabilize you.Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until depleted or you finish a long rest.\n\nDAMAGE ROLLS\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant \u000ea bonus to damage. A penalty might cause you to deal 0 damage, but you never deal negative damage. en a acking with a weapon, add your ability modifier the same modifier used for the a ack roll to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball, the player rolls damage once for all creatures caught in the blast.\n\nCRITICAL HITS\n en you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the a ack s damage against the target. Roll all of the a ack s damage dice twice and add them together.  en add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all damage dice at once.For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the a ack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue s Sneak A ack feature, roll those dice twice as well.\n\nDAMAGE TYPES\nDifferent a acks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types. e damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.Acid.  e corrosive spray of a black dragon s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.Bludgeoning. Blunt force a acks hammers, falling, constriction, and the like deal bludgeoning damage.Cold.  e infernal chill radiating from an ice devil s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon s breath deal cold damage.Fire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.Force. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon s breath deal lightning damage.Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain Undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers ma er and even the soul.Piercing. Puncturing and impaling a acks, including spears and monsters  bites, deal piercing damage.Poison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon s breath deal poison damage.Psychic. Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage.Black Flag Roleplaying44Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric s flame strike spell or an angel s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.Slashing. Swords, axes, and monsters  claws deal slashing damage. under. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\n\nDAMAGE RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.Resistance and then vulnerability are applied a er all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an a ack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage.  e creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5.  e 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n\nHEALING\nUnless it results in death, damage isn t permanent. Rest can restore a creature s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant. en a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature s hit points can t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points, not 8.A creature that dies can t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\n\nDROPPING TO 0 HIT POINTS\n en you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\n\nINSTANT DEATH\nMassive damage can kill you instantly.  en damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\u000eFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an a ack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, and 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\n\nFALLING UNCONSCIOUS\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see Appendix).  is unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\n\nDEATH SAVES\n enever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special save, called a death save, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saves, this one isn t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a save.Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die.Successes and failures don t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.  e number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.Rolling 1 or 20.  en you make a death save and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death save failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\n\nSTABILIZING A CREATURE\n e best way to help a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn t killed by a failed death save.You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and a empt to stabilize it with a successful DC 10 WIS (Medicine) check.A stable creature doesn t make death saves, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.  e creature stops being stable, and must start making death saves again if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn t healed regains 1 hit point a er 1d4 hours.\n\nMONSTERS AND DEATH\nMonsters generally die the instant they drop to 0 hit points, since tracking death saves for a dozen monsters can be tedious.Mighty villains and special NPCs are common exceptions, though.  e GM can decide to have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as PCs.45 Chaptier 2: Playing the GameKNOCKING A CREATURE OUT UNDERWATER COMBAT Sometimes an a acker wants to incapacitate a foe rather  en adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea than deal a killing blow.  en an a acker reduces a homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find creature to 0 hit points with a melee a ack, the a acker themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a can choose to knock the creature out instead of killing it. challenging environment.

You can t mount it if you don t have 15 feet of movement le  or if your speed is 0.If an effect moves your mount against its will while you re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same save with the same results.If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount and land on your feet as it falls. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet of it.\n\nCONTROLLING A MOUNT\n ile you re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, generally prefer to act independently.You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training.  e initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to devour a downed foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity a ack while you re on it, the a acker can target you or the mount."

        "Combat\n\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, involving weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into rounds and turns, with each round representing about 6 seconds in the game world. Each participant in the battle takes a turn during a round. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter when all participants, including player characters (PCs) and monsters, roll initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round unless one side has defeated the other.\n\nSurprise\n\nSurprise can occur when one side gains the advantage over the other by stealthily approaching or catching them off guard. The Game Master (GM) determines who might be surprised. If neither side is being stealthy, they automatically notice each other. To determine surprise, the GM compares the DEX (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the Perception score of each creature on the opposing side. Anyone who doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter. Being surprised means you can't move or take an action on your first turn of combat and can't take a reaction until your turn ends. It's possible for some members of a group to be surprised while others are not.\n\nInitiative\n\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. At the start of combat, everyone involved rolls initiative to determine the order of combatants' turns. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time. The combatants are ranked in initiative order from highest to lowest DEX check result. Initiative order remains the same from round to round. If there is a tie, the GM and players decide the order among tied characters and creatures. Optionally, tied characters and monsters can each roll a d20 to determine the order.\n\nYour Turn\n\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move or take your action first. Your speed is noted on your character sheet and represents how far you can move. The most common actions you can take are described in the Actions in Combat section of the game rules. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action. You don't have to move or take an action if you can't decide what to do on your turn. In that case, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in the Actions in Combat section.\n\nBonus Actions\n\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities allow you to take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. For example, the Cunning Action feature allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a class feature, spell, or other special ability states that you can do something as a bonus action. You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which one to use if you have more than one available. You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the timing of the bonus action is specified. If something prevents you from taking an action, it also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\n\nReactions\n\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger, which can occur on your turn or someone else's. The most common type of reaction is the opportunity attack, which allows you to make an attack when a hostile creature moves out of your reach. When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If your reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.\n\nOther Activity on Your Turn\n\nYour turn can include minor actions or interactions that don't require your action or movement. You can communicate through brief talking and gestures at any time. You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free during either your movement or action. For example, you could open a door during your move or draw your weapon as part of your Attack action. If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magical items and special objects require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions. The GM may require you to use an action for activities that require special care or present unusual obstacles, such as opening a stuck door or turning a crank to lower a drawbridge.\n\nMovement and Position\n\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain an advantage. On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like, following the rules provided in the game. Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming, either combined with walking or as your entire move. However you move, deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\n\nBreaking Up Your Move\n\nYou can break up your movement on your turn by using some speed before and the remainder after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\n\nUsing Different Speeds\n\nIf you have more than one speed, such as a walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between them during your move. Each time you switch, subtract the distance you have already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet and a flying speed of 60 feet, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet. If you wanted to walk any farther, you would be done for your move, but you could still use your flying speed to move 30 feet more.\n\nDifficult Terrain\n\nCombat rarely takes place in open areas. The game recognizes various challenging terrains, such as rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs, that can impede movement. Each foot of movement in difficult terrain costs an extra foot. Difficult terrain can also include the space of another creature, which counts as difficult terrain for you.\n\nBeing Prone\n\nCombatants can find themselves lying on the ground either because they are knocked down or choose to throw themselves down. When prone, a creature has the prone condition. Dropping prone is free and doesn't require any movement, but standing up from prone costs movement equal to half your speed. Crawling is the most efficient way to move while prone, with each foot of movement while crawling costing an extra foot. Crawling through difficult terrain costs 3 feet of movement per foot crawled.\n\nMoving Around Other Creatures\n\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature's space, but moving through a hostile creature's space is only possible if the creature is two or more sizes larger or smaller than you. Another creature's space counts as difficult terrain for you, and you can't willingly end your move in its space. If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack from that creature.\n\nFlying Movement\n\nFlying creatures can enjoy many benefits, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls unless it has the ability to hover or is being held aloft by magic, such as the fly spell.\n\nCreature Size\n\nEach creature takes up a specific amount of space on the battlefield. Size categories determine the space a creature controls in combat. The size categories are Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, and Gargantuan. A creature's space is not an expression of its physical dimensions but rather the area it effectively controls.\n\nSpace\n\nA creature's space is the area, usually expressed in feet, that it controls in combat. It reflects both its physical dimensions and the area it needs to fight effectively. For example, a Medium creature controls a 5-foot square.\n\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space\n\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. For example, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that is only 5 feet wide. While squeezing, a creature must spend extra movement for each foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and DEX saves. Attacks against the creature have advantage while it's squeezing.\n\nActions in Combat\n\nThe most common action in combat is the Attack action, which allows you to make a melee or ranged attack. Depending on your class, you may also have access to additional actions. Spells and special abilities can provide other action options. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM determines whether it is possible and may require rolls to determine success or failure.\n\nAttack\n\nThe Attack action allows you to make one melee or ranged attack against a target within your attack's range. Different weapons and spells have specific rules for making an attack. When making an attack, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total meets or exceeds the target's AC, the attack hits. Certain features, such as the fighter's Multiattack, allow you to make multiple attacks with this action.\n\nCast a Spell\n\nSpellcasting characters and some monsters can take the Cast a Spell action in combat to cast a spell. You can only cast spells with a casting time of 1 action using this action. Spells with longer casting times require their own specific actions.\n\nDash\n\nThe Dash action grants you additional movement on your turn. You can move up to your speed, multiplied by two, when you take this action. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you can move up to 60 feet with a Dash action.\n\nDisengage\n\nThe Disengage action allows you to move without provoking opportunity attacks for the rest of your turn. This can be useful if you need to move away from an enemy without risking being attacked.\n\nDodge\n\nThe Dodge action allows you to focus on avoiding attacks until the start of your next turn. While dodging, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against you have disadvantage if you can see the attacker. This benefits is lost if you become incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.\n\nHelp\n\nThe Help action allows you to aid another creature in completing a task. This can involve providing advantage on ability checks or helping an ally to make their attack more effective. The specifics of how this action works depend on the situation and the GM's rulings.\n\nHide\n\nThe Hide action allows you to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide, attempting to avoid detection. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits described in the rules for unseen attackers and targets.\n\nReady\n\nThe Ready action allows you to prepare an action or move to be triggered by a specific circumstance on someone else's turn. For example, you could ready an attack to be made when a creature steps on a trap. This action requires you to use your reaction, and you must state the trigger and the action or move you will take when the trigger occurs.\n\nSearch\n\nThe Search action allows you to devote your attention to finding something. The GM may require ability checks, such as Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation), depending on the nature of your search.\n\nUse an Object\n\nThe Use an Object action allows you to interact with an object or feature in the environment. This action is usually required when interacting with more than one object on your turn or when interacting with a complex or tricky object that requires an ability check.\n\nMaking an Attack\n\nWhen making an attack, the attacker rolls an attack roll to determine if the attack hits the target. The attack roll is determined by rolling a d20 and adding relevant modifiers. If the attack roll equals or exceeds the target's AC, the attack hits. The specific modifiers and rules for the attack depend on the weapon or spell being used.\n\nAttack Rolls\n\nAn attack roll is determined by rolling a d20 and adding the relevant modifiers. The two most common modifiers are the ability modifier, which is either Strength or Dexterity depending on the weapon being used, and the proficiency bonus, which is added if the attacker is proficient with the weapon. The attack roll is compared to the target's AC to determine if the attack hits.\n\nModifiers to the Roll\n\nWhen making an attack roll, the attacker adds their ability modifier and proficiency bonus, if applicable, to the roll. The ability modifier used depends on the weapon being used. When using a spell that requires an attack roll, the ability modifier used is based on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.\n\nRolling 1 or 20\n\nIf the attack roll is a 20, it is a critical hit and the attack automatically hits, regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. The attacker then rolls all of the attack's damage dice twice and adds them together. If the attack roll is a 1, it is a critical failure and the attack automatically misses, regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.\n\nUnseen Attackers and Targets\n\nWhen attacking a target that you can't see, either because they are hiding or due to visibility conditions, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This disadvantage applies even if you can guess the target's location or if you can hear, but not see, the target. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, the attack automatically misses. On the other hand, if you are unseen by a target, you have advantage on attack rolls against them. If you are both unseen and unheard when making an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\n\nCover\n\nCover can provide protection during combat, making it more difficult for attackers to hit their targets. There are three degrees of cover: half cover, three-quarters cover, and total cover. Half cover grants a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saves, while three-quarters cover grants a +5 bonus. Total cover means that the target can't be targeted directly by an attack or spell.\n\nRanged Attacks\n\nRanged attacks involve using weapons or spells to strike at targets from a distance. Each ranged attack has a specific range, and attacks beyond the weapon's normal range have disadvantage. Certain weapons, such as crossbows and nets, have different rules for ranged attacks. Attacks made with ranged weapons in close combat have disadvantage unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\n\nMelee Attacks\n\nMelee attacks involve making physical strikes at targets within your reach. Different weapons and spells have specific rules for making melee attacks. Most creatures have a reach of 5 feet, allowing them to make melee attacks against targets within 5 feet of them. Some creatures, typically larger ones, have longer reach for melee attacks. Unarmed strikes, such as punches or kicks, also count as melee attacks. Attacks made with melee weapons add the relevant ability modifier to the damage.\n\nOpportunity Attacks\n\nAn opportunity attack is a reaction that can be triggered when a hostile creature moves out of your reach. When this happens, you can make a melee attack against the provoking creature. The opportunity attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. Taking the Disengage action can avoid provoking an opportunity attack.\n\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\n\nWhen you have a light melee weapon in each hand, you can use the Two-Weapon Fighting action to make a second attack with the weapon in your other hand as a bonus action. This action allows you to make an additional attack but does not add your ability modifier to the damage unless the modifier is negative. The weapon used for the bonus attack can be thrown if it has the thrown property.\n\nGrappling\n\nThe Grapple action allows you to make a special melee attack to grapple a creature. You can use one free hand to try and seize the target. This is a contested check, with the attacker making a Strength (Athletics) check and the target choosing between a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins, the target becomes grappled. The grappled condition specifies how it can end.\n\nShoving\n\nThe Shove action allows you to make a special melee attack to shove a creature. This can knock the target prone or push it away from you. Like grappling, shoving is a contested check, with the attacker making a Strength (Athletics) check against the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Success allows the attacker to knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away."

        "\n\nCHAPTER 3: EQUIPMENT & MAGIC ITEMS\nEquipmentThis section covers the standard nonmagical equipment available and the rules concerning their use.\n\nARMOR\nWearing armor increases your armor class (AC), which in turn increases your chance of avoiding enemy attacks. When an enemy attempts an attack, their attack roll total must meet or beat your AC to deal damage. So, the higher your AC, the greater the chance of avoiding damage! The Armor table lists the cost, AC bonus, weight, special properties, and proficiencies required to successfully use the various kinds of armor.\n\nARMOR TYPES & PROFICIENCIES\nEach armor is categorized into a type that is associated with a proficiency. For instance, a character with proficiency in light armor can wear any of the kinds of armor listed in the light armor section of the armor table without penalty. Your character can wear any kind of armor, but if you don’t have proficiency, you have disadvantage on all STR and DEX ability checks made while wearing it. It is also impossible to cast spells while wearing armor you aren’t proficient with.\n\nLIGHT ARMOR\nLight armor provides minimal protection while still allowing its wearer to move with relative ease. Its flexibility makes it the go-to choice for rogues and other DEX-based character builds.\n\nMEDIUM ARMOR\nMedium armor provides more protection than light armor, but it uses bulkier materials that interfere with range of motion. The additional protection offered by medium armor makes it a popular choice for clerics who need to be close enough to the danger to aid their allies, but don’t need to move quickly around the battlefield.This chapter lists the equipment available to PCs and explains additional rules on the topic. It also contains a few magic items PCs might find during their adventures.CurrencyCoins used in the game are minted in precious metals generally considered valuable by most cultures. This standardization of value is widely accepted, even by communities that wouldn’t traditionally value such things.The four most common coins are the copper piece (cp), the silver piece (sp), the gold piece (gp), and the platinum piece (pp). Average coins weigh less than half an ounce. A pouch of 50 coins weighs 1 pound.\n\nCURRENCY CONVERSION\n\n\nCOIN CP SP GP PP\nCopper (cp) 1 1/10 1/100 1/1,000Silver (sp) 10 1 1/10 1/100Gold (gp) 100 10 1 1/10Platinum (pp) 1,000 100 10 1Selling Nonmagical ItemsMost nonmagical equipment can be resold for half its original value, assuming it is in good shape. Equipment retrieved from the corpses of monsters is rarely in resale condition. Nonmagical treasures like cut gemstones, works of art, or fine jewelry can generally be resold at full price.For rules on buying and selling magic items, see the Magic Items section later in this chapter.Black Flag Roleplaying 48\n\nHEAVY ARMOR\nHeavy armor provides the most protection of any armor type, but wearing it demands great physical prowess. Fighters are one of the few character classes that can take full advantage of heavy armor’s defensive capabilities. \n\nSHIELDS\nShields are a unique type of armor because they are held instead of worn. This means you can lose their AC bonus if the shield is destroyed or dropped. Wielding a shield requires the use of one hand, which means a PC can’t use two-handed weapons while holding a shield. You can only benefit from one shield AC bonus at a time, even while holding multiple shields.\n\nARMOR PROPERTIES\nCertain sets of armor have properties that affect how they are used, as shown in the Properties column of the Armor table.Cumbersome. This armor is heavy and difficult to move in unless you possess the required STR. If a player character does not have a STR score equal to or greater than the STR score listed in parentheses, their movement speed is reduced by 10 feet while they wear the armor, even if they are proficient with it.Natural Materials. This armor does not interfere with a druid’s ability to cast spells. At GM’s discretion, a shield can have this property.Noisy. This armor imposes disadvantage on any ability checks made to avoid notice, like sneaking, hiding, or otherwise attempting to move silently.\n\nGETTING INTO AND OUT OF ARMOR\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.Don. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.Doff. This is the time it takes to remove armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.\n\nDONNING AND DOFFING ARMOR\n\n\nCATEGORY DON DOFF\nLight Armor 1 minute 1 minuteMedium Armor 5 minutes 1 minuteHeavy Armor 10 minutes 5 minutesShield 1 action 1 action\n\nARMOR\n\n\nARMOR COST AC BONUS WEIGHT PROPERTIES\nLight Armor Leather 10 gp 11 + DEX modifier 10 lb.

Unless you have a feature that allows you to work around this (such as the Combat Caster talent), your spellcasting capabilities suffer while you hold both a weapon and a shield.49 Chaptier 3: Equipment & Magic Items\n\nWEAPONS\nThe Weapons table lists the cost, damage dice and type, weight, weapon options, and special properties for common weapons. The table is also split by proficiencies required (simple and martial) to successfully wield the various weapons. \n\nWEAPON TYPES & PROFICIENCIES\nEach weapon is categorized into a type associated with a proficiency. For instance, a character with proficiency in martial weapons gets to add their PB to attack rolls made with any weapon listed in the martial weapons section of the Weapons table.Any character can wield any weapon, but only a character with proficiency can add their PB to attack rolls with those weapons.\n\nMELEE WEAPONS\nMelee weapons are used to attack nearby targets (typically within 5 feet).\n\nRANGED WEAPONS\nRanged weapons are used to attack targets at a distance.\n\nSIMPLE WEAPONS\nSimple weapons require little experience to use effectively. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners.\n\nMARTIAL WEAPONS\nMartial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons tend to deal more damage and put their training to best use.\n\nWEAPON OPTIONS\nThis section offers unique options for using weapons in ways other than dealing damage, giving different weapons distinct impacts on the battlefield, as shown in the Weapons table.A character can use a weapon option only if the character is wielding and proficient with a weapon. If an option requires a creature to make an ability check or save, the DC equals 8 + the attacker’s PB + the attacker’s STR or DEX modifier (attacker’s choice).Unless specified otherwise, a weapon used to perform a weapon option has only the option’s listed effect and doesn’t deal normal weapon damage. If a weapon option instructs a character to make and attack with the weapon, and the character can make multiple attacks with the Attack action, the weapon option replaces only one of those attacks.At the GM’s discretion, some weapon options might not work against certain creatures. For example, the trip weapon option might not work against a creature without discernable legs, such as an ooze, or that is anchored or attached to the ground in some way, such as a tree with animated limbs.\n\nBASH\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can hit the target in the side of the head or other vital organ, disorienting it for a moment. Make an attack roll with this weapon. On a hit, the target is briefly disoriented and has disadvantage on its next attack roll.\n\nDISARM\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can choose to aim a jarring hit at the target’s held weapon, knocking it from their grasp. Make an attack roll with this weapon. On a hit, the target must succeed on a STR or DEX save (target’s choice) or drop its weapon, which lands in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If no unoccupied space is within range, the weapon lands at the target’s feet.\n\nIMPROVISED WEAPONS\nSometimes characters don’t have their favorite weapons and must fight with whatever’s handy. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.When in doubt about how much damage an object should deal, find a weapon on the Weapons table most like the object and use its damage die. For example, a table leg is a lot like a club. At the GM’s discretion, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and add their PB as normal.If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, those are considered improvised weapons, and typically deal 1d4 damage of an appropriate damage type. An improvised thrown weapon typically has range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.Black Flag Roleplaying 50\n\nPINNING SHOT\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can choose to shoot part of a Large or smaller creature’s clothing and pin the clothing to the ground or nearby object or structure. The target must be wearing clothing, such as boots or a cloak, and must be on the ground or within 5 feet of an object or structure. Make an attack roll with this weapon. On a hit, the target can’t move from its current space. A creature, including the target, can take its action to rip the cloth, pull out the arrow or bolt, unclasp or wriggle out of the clothing, or free itself in some other way \n\nHAMSTRING\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can make a painful but superficial wound on a leg of a Large or smaller creature. Make an attack roll with this weapon. On a hit, the target’s walking speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. A creature’s speed can’t be reduced by more than 10 feet with this weapon option. A creature within 5 feet of the target can take an action to tend the wound with a successful WIS (Medicine) check (against your weapon option DC), ending the effect on the target. The effect also ends if the target receives magical healing.\n\nWEAPONS\n\n\nWEAPON COST DAMAGE WEIGHT WEAPON OPTION PROPERTIES\nSimple Melee Weapons Club 1 sp 1d6 bludgeoning 2 lb.

You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of an encounter, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking 1 minute to search the battlefield.If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see Improvised Weapons sidebar). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, use your choice of your STR or DEX modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.Loading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw it to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, use your STR, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your STR or your DEX, since the dagger has the finesse property.Two-Handed. This weapon requires you to use two hands when you attack with it.Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. These weapons have two damage values listed. The higher damage value is used when you use two hands to make a melee attack.by succeeding on a STR or DEX check (target’s choice). The target must make only one check to free itself, using the highest DC of characters performing this weapon option, regardless of the number of arrows or bolts holding it in place.\n\nPULL\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can pull a Large or smaller creature up to 5 feet closer to you as you slide the weapon’s haft around the creature. Make an attack roll with this weapon. On a hit, the target is pulled up to 5 feet closer to you. If this movement would pull a creature into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, it can make a STR or DEX (target’s choice) save, avoiding the pull on a success.\n\nRICOCHET SHOT\nAs an action, you can ricochet an attack off an object or structure to hit a target you can see that has half or three-quarters cover. The target must be within 10 feet of an object or structure that isn’t providing it with cover, and that object or structure must be within your weapon’s normal range. Make an attack roll with this weapon against the target’s AC as if it weren't behind cover. On a hit, the target takes damage as if hit by your attack. This weapon option expends the same ammunition as a normal attack with this weapon. This attack doesn’t deal extra damage from features such as Sneak Attack, but it can deal extra damage from a magical effect on the ammunition, such as a +1 shortbow or an arrow of slaying.\n\nTRIP\nWhen you make an attack with this weapon, you can choose to sweep the weapon at a Large or smaller creature’s legs. The target must succeed on a STR or DEX save (target’s choice) or fall prone. If the target is mounted, it has advantage on the save.Black Flag Roleplaying 52\n\nADVENTURING GEAR AND TOOLS\nEquipment that is useful for adventurers, but isn’t armor or weapons, is called adventuring gear. The Adventuring Gear table lists the price and weight of items commonly available for purchase. Any items that have special rules or require further explanation are listed in the Special Gear section.the power of arcane circle spells. A wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from a pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.Barding. Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids and weighs twice as much.Book. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper.\n\nEQUIPMENT PACKS\nThe starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.Burglar’s Pack (16 gp).

Includes a backpack, a book of lore, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, 10 sheets of parchment, a little bag of sand, and a small knife.\n\nSPECIAL GEAR\nThis section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist’s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 DEX check to extinguish the flames.Antitoxin. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saves against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to Undead or Constructs.Arcane Focus.

A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell’s description).Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to STR checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has 10 uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points without needing to make a WIS (Medicine) check.Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage—otherwise, the water has no effect.A cleric may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st\u0002ring spell slot.Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 DEX check.Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. To escape the manacles, a creature must use their action to make a successful DC 20 DEX check or break them with a successful DC 20 STR check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 DEX check. Manacles are an object with AC 19 and 15 hit points.Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot\u0002square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.Poison, Basic. The poison in this vial can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action.

For more information about this item, see potion of healing in the Magic Item Descriptions section later in this chapter.Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows or 20 crossbow bolts.Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. One unit of rations is enough to feed one Medium or smaller creature for one day.Rope. Rope is an object with AC 11 and 2 hit points. It can be burst with a DC 17 STR check.Saddle. A riding saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle.

The Mounts table shows each animal’s speed and base carrying capacity.An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, add their carrying capacity together.Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.Vehicle Proficiency. If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your PB to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.Rowed Vessels. Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.\n\nMOUNTS\n\n\nMOUNT COST\n\n\nSPEED (PER \n\n\nROUND)\n\n\nCARRYING \n\n\nCAPACITY\nDonkey or mule 8 gp 40 ft. 420 lb.Horse, draft 50 gp 40 ft. 540 lb.Horse, riding 75 gp 60 ft. 480 lb.Mastiff 25 gp 40 ft. 195 lb.Pony 30 gp 40 ft. 225 lb.Warhorse 400 gp 60 ft. 540 lb.\n\nDRAWN VEHICLES\n\n\nITEM COST WEIGHT\nCarriage 100 gp 600 lb.Cart 15 gp 200 lb.Chariot 250 gp 100 lb.Sled 20 gp 300 lb.Wagon 35 gp 400 lb.\n\nWATERBORNE VEHICLES\n\n\nITEM COST SPEED\nGalley 30,000 gp 4 mphKeelboat 3,000 gp 1 mphLongship 10,000 gp 3 mphRowboat 50 gp 1½ mphSailing ship 10,000 gp 2 mphWarship 25,000 gp 2½ mph\n\nFOOD, DRINK, AND LODGING\nThe Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night’s lodging.\n\nFOOD, DRINK, AND LODGING\n\n\nITEM COST\nAlePitcher (Gallon) 2 spMug 4 cpInn stay (per day)Typical room 5 spLuxury room 2 gpMeals (per day)Meal, common 3 spMeal, feast 2 gpWineCommon (pitcher) 2 spFine (bottle) 10 gp57 Chaptier 3: Equipment & Magic Items\n\nSERVICES\nAdventurers can pay NPCs to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.Some basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city and whom the adventurers pay to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance for the duke.Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, they might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward all the way down to stable cleaners. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the compensation.Skilled hirelings include anyone employed to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.Magic ItemsOf the many rewards available to adventurers, magic items are perhaps the most coveted. These powerful objects are created using raw magic and are incredibly complicated to produce. Few beings in the world possess the knowledge to make magic items, which makes them hard to find and valuable.The GM is the ultimate arbiter of where magic items appear, but they are often given as rewards for crawling through deadly dungeons or slaying the creatures that guard them. \n\nUSING A MAGIC ITEM\nUsing a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, the GM can rule that it doesn’t adjust. When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, it is up to GM discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a serpentfolk with a tail instead of legs can’t wear boots.\n\nMULTIPLE ITEMS OF THE SAME KIND\nUse common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks.\n\nPAIRED ITEMS\nItems that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either.\n\nATTUNEMENT\nSome magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for attunement. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not from using a magic item or the like.Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.Black Flag Roleplaying 58has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained.\n\nMAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS\nThis section lists some magic items found within the known universe. Each entry provides key information about the item, including its rarity category, whether or not it requires attunement to use, its price, and a description of its properties.Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3Weapon (Any Ammunition), Rarity Varies Price VariesYou have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it successfully hits a target, the ammunition becomes a nonmagical piece of ammunition.\n\nAMMUNITION\n\n\nBONUS RARITY COST\n+1 Uncommon 50 gp (each)+2 Rare 100 gp (each)+3 Very Rare 350 gp (each)Armor, +1, +2, or +3Armor (Light, Medium, Heavy), Rarity Varies Price VariesWhile wearing this armor, you receive the armor’s standard bonus to AC and an additional AC bonus equal to its rarity bonus.\n\nARMOR\n\n\nBONUS RARITY COST\n+1 Rare 1,500 gp + armor base cost+2 Very Rare 7,500 gp + armor base cost+3 Legendary 25,000 gp + armor base costBag of DevouringWondrous Item, Very Rare 15,000 gpThis bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic, extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out temporarily closes the orifice. The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside of it. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches in, there is a 50 percent An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than a number of items equal to its proficiency bonus (PB) at any one time. Any attempt to attune to an additional item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.\n\nACTIVATING AN ITEM\nActivating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of an item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the Use an Item action.\n\nCOMMAND WORD\nA command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can’t be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell.\n\nSPELLS\nSome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell ring, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a spellcasting ability, your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your PB does apply.\n\nCHARGES\nSome magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item 59 Chaptier 3: Equipment & Magic Itemschance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 STR (Athletics) check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 STR (Athletics) check (assuming that creature wasn’t also pulled inside the bag). Any creature that that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, and its body is destroyed.The bag holds up to 1 cubic foot of inanimate, non-organic objects without a fuss. However, once each day, the bag swallows these types of objects placed in the bag and spits them out into a random plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed. Anything within it is transported to a random location on a random plane determined by the GM.Bag of HoldingWondrous Item, Uncommon 1,000 gpThis bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in another plane of existence. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to another plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location within another plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.Bead of ForceWondrous Item, Rare 650 gpThis small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs 1 ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads of force are found together.You can use an action to throw a bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that fails the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeed on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.Crystal BallWondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement) Price VariesThe typical crystal ball is a very rare magic item about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (save DC 17) with it.The following crystal ball variants are legendary items and have additional properties.Crystal Ball of Mind Reading. You can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You don’t need to concentrate to maintain detect thoughts for the duration of the spell, but it ends if scrying ends.Crystal Ball of Telepathy. While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don’t need to concentrate to maintain suggestion for the duration of the spell, but it ends if scrying ends. The suggestion power of the crystal ball can’t be used again until the next dawn.Crystal Ball of True Seeing. While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell’s sensor.\n\nCRYSTAL BALL\n\n\nVARIANT RARITY COST\nCrystal Ball Very Rare 30,000 gp Crystal Ball of Mind Reading Legendary 52,000 gpCrystal Ball of Telepathy Legendary 60,000 gp Crystal Ball of True Seeing Legendary 70,000 gpImmovable RodRod, Uncommon 1,000 gpThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it defies gravity. The rod can hold up Black Flag Roleplaying 60to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 STR check, moving a fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.Oil of SlipperinessPotion, Uncommon 350 gpThis sticky, black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it wears and carries (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.Potion of HealingPotion, Rarity Varies Price VariesThis red, glimmering potion allows you to regain hit points when you drink it. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown on the Potions of Healing table.\n\nPOTIONS OF HEALING\n\n\nPOTION OF… RARITY\n\n\nHP \n\n\nREGAINED PRICE\nHealing Common 2d4 + 2 50 gp Greater Healing Uncommon 4d4 + 4 100 gpSuperior Healing Rare 8d4 + 8 350 gp Supreme Healing Very Rare 10d4 + 20 1,500 gpSpell ScrollScroll, Rarity Varies Price VariesA spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your circle’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, it is unintelligible.Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.If the spell is on your circle’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s ring. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.The spell ring determines the scroll’s rarity, save DC, attack bonus, and price, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.An arcane circle spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an INT (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s ring. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, copying destroys the scroll.\n\nSPELL SCROLL\n\n\nSPELL \n\n\nRING RARITY\n\n\nSAVE \n\n\nDC\n\n\nATTACK \n\n\nBONUS PRICE\nCantrip Common 13 +5 10 gp 1st Common 13 +5 50 gp2nd Uncommon 13 +5 100 gp 3rd Uncommon 15 +7 200 gp4th Rare 15 +7 350 gp5th Rare 17 +9 650 gp6th Very Rare 17 +9 1,500 gp7th Very Rare 18 +10 2,500 gp8th Very Rare 18 +10 5,000 gp9th Legendary 19 +11 10,500 gpWand of SecretsWand, Uncommon 500 gpThis wand has 3 charges.

        "CHAPTER 1: CHARACTER CREATION\n\nThe first step to play is creating your player character (PC). Character creation involves making rule choices that define who your character is and what your character is good at, as well as creative choices about your character's history and personality.\n\nThis chapter contains exact steps and options to create your character. If you are creating a character for the first time, it can be helpful to work with your game master (GM) to choose options that make a good play experience.\n\nStep-by-Step Character Creation\n\nThese are the steps needed to create your character.\n\nSTEP 0: GATHER MATERIALS\n\nMake sure to have these basic tools handy to record your character choices:\n- Pencil\n- Blank character sheet\n- Scratch paper\n- Dice (see \"About Those Dice\" in the sidebar)\n\nABOUT THOSE DICE\n\nThe Black Flag Roleplaying system uses polyhedral dice to resolve actions. These dice are abbreviated in game text, so a four-sided die is a d4, a six-sided die is a d6, and so on for d8, d10, d12, and d20. Percentile dice rolls (1-100) are rolled with two dice and abbreviated d%.\n\nSTEP 1: CREATE A CHARACTER CONCEPT\n\nIt can help to think about what kind of character you want to play before you start picking from lists. Do you want to cast magic spells? Do you want to be good at swinging a sword? Do you want to play as a human or a member of some more fantastical lineage? Knowing what sounds like fun to you can help guide your decisions.\n\nTalk to the other players about your ideas if they're around. Hearing what other players have in mind can help focus your choices or inspire you to create a concept that works well with other adventurers in your party. For example, if all the other PCs are rough-and-tumble warriors, you might want to make a cleric so you can patch them up with healing magic!\n\nSTEP 2: CHOOSE A CLASS\n\nChoosing your character's class is the most important factor in bringing your concept into the game. Your character's class is sort of like their job. Each class covers a different set of capabilities and responsibilities.\n\nYour character class gives you class features at 1st level as described in each class features table (see Character Classes later in this chapter) and lists other features you gain access to as your character gains adventuring experience and levels up. Your choice of character class also dictates your proficiencies, which is a game term describing what kinds of equipment you are trained to use (like armor, weapons, or tools) and what kinds of challenges you are best at handling (skills and saves).\n\nChoosing your character class can also help you make other decisions. For example, each class has a Quick Build section that tells you which ability scores (described in Step 3) work best with your class abilities. See the Class Options at a Glance table later in this chapter for a brief summary and comparison of each class.\n\nSTEP 3: DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES\n\nAt their core, characters are defined by six abilities:\n- Strength (STR), representing your physical might.\n- Dexterity (DEX), representing your agility and reaction time.\n- Constitution (CON), representing your endurance and physical fortitude.\n- Intelligence (INT), representing your ability to acquire and apply knowledge.\n- Wisdom (WIS), representing your intuition and mental fortitude.\n- Charisma (CHA), representing your self-confidence and your ability to influence others.\n\nEach ability is assigned a number, called an ability score. These scores represent your various physical and mental abilities. Higher numbers in a score mean your character is better with that ability.\n\nAs you level up, you can increase these scores, but a PC can never have an ability score higher than 20. An average person has 10 in every ability score, so these numbers emphasize how powerful adventurers are!\n\nTHREE WAYS TO SCORE\n\nThere are three methods to determine your starting ability scores. No method is \"better\" than another, but some people like one way more, so we include them to appeal to different kinds of players.\n\nMETHOD ONE: ROLLING\n\nThis is the classic method, providing surprises and maybe a tough choice. It helps make a character you adapt to, instead of you making all the decisions:\n- Roll four d6s. Find the lowest die and throw it out. Then add up the remaining three dice to get your total. Write that number down on scratch paper.\n- Do this five more times until you have six totals between 3 and 18.\n- Assign those six numbers to the ability scores however you like.\n- Finally, add 2 to one score of your choice that is 16 or below and add 1 to one score of your choice that is 17 or below.\n\nMETHOD TWO: POINT-BUY\n\nIf you don't want to leave it up to chance, you can assign ability scores with the point-buy method:\n- Start with 32 points to spend on your ability scores.\n- Each score costs a certain number of points. Find the cost of each potential score on the Point-Buy Cost table. (As an example, a score of 12 costs 4 points.)\n- 18 is the highest ability score you can start with, and you can't have a score lower than 8.\n- Buy one score for each of the six abilities.\n- Don't add anything extra when you're done here. These numbers are already balanced without adding more.\n\nPOINT-BUY COST TABLE\n\nSCORE COST  SCORE COST  SCORE COST\n  8      0        12      4       16      11\n  9      1        13      5       17      13\n 10      2        14      7       18      16\n 11      3       15        9\n\nMETHOD THREE: STANDARD ARRAY\n\nTo get started faster, use the standard array. Start with six numbers: 16, 14, 14, 13, 10, and 8. Assign them as ability scores however you want. Again, don't modify them any further. That's it!\n\nFIND ABILITY MODIFIERS\n\nOnce you assign scores, use the following charts to figure out your ability modifiers. Your ability modifiers are the most important part of your ability scores. You use your modifiers much more than your score to calculate success or failure in the game.\n\nABILITY MODIFIERS\n\nABILITY SCORE  MODIFIER\n       1             -5\n     2-3            -4\n     4-5            -3\n     6-7            -2\n     8-9            -1\n   10-11           +0\n   12-13           +1\n   14-15           +2\n   16-17           +3\n   18-19           +4\n      20           +5\n\nPC Wisdom: When you see an ability referenced in the rules, assume it means the ability score modifier (-1, 0, +1, +2, etc.) rather than the ability score itself (8, 10, 12, 14, etc.). For example, if a feature reads \"...roll and add your STR,\" that means add your Strength ability modifier, not your full Strength ability score.\n\nSTEP 4: CHOOSE A LINEAGE\n\nChoose your character's lineage from the options in the Lineage section later in this chapter. Lineage tells you about certain hereditary traits such as average lifespan, size, speed, and any special adaptations like the ability to see in the dark.\n\nLineage represents the blood ties and hereditary traits of a creature. Adventurers can be humans or a common fantasy lineage, like dwarves or elves.\n\nSTEP 5: CHOOSE A HERITAGE\n\nChoose your character's heritage from the options in the Heritage section later in this chapter. Heritage tells you about traits your character has because of their connection to a particular group or society.\n\nHeritage represents the upbringing and culture of a character. Adventurers can come from nearly any kind of fantasy society, such as a big city, a forest enclave, or an underground citadel.\n\nSTEP 6: CHOOSE A BACKGROUND\n\nChoose your character's background from the options in the Backgrounds section later in this chapter. Backgrounds give you skill proficiencies, talents, and languages learned.\n\nBackgrounds represent what your character did as an individual before they took up the adventuring life. Adventurers are often a motley group and come from a wide variety of backgrounds. Backgrounds include options like adherent or scholar.\n\nSTEP 7: FILL IN THE BLANKS\n\nAt this point, your big decisions are locked in. You still need to equip your character (see Chapter 3) and pick spells if they're a spellcaster (see Chapter 4). But you've got the basics squared away.\n\nTake some time to look things over and fill in any blank sections on your character sheet (see Final Checklist below). Make sure to give your character a name and decide what they look like. It's also a good idea to think about your character's history and personality—but it's perfectly fine to decide these details later. You might discover more about who you want your character to be after playing for a couple of game sessions.\n"

        "Character Classes\n\nEvery adventurer has a character class that dictates the heroic features they have access to. It can be helpful to think of a character's class like their job, with each type covering a different set of capabilities and responsibilities. The Class Options at a Glance table gives an overview about the classes detailed in this section.\n\nElements of a Class\n\nThis section breaks down the various components of a character class.\n\nProgression Table\nThe Progression table for your class tells you what class features you get at 1st level and what new features you gain as you level up.\n\nLevel\nCharacters start at 1st level and can advance up to 20th level. See the After Level 1 sidebar for more on this.\n\nProficiency Bonus\nProficiency bonus (PB) represents the benefit of training. As your character advances in levels, their training leads to improved performance at things they are proficient in. Every class advances at the same rate, but we put the progression in each class Progression table for convenience.\n\nAfter Level 1\nCharacters start at 1st level and can advance up to 20th level by gaining experience points (XP) during their adventures. By default, PCs start with 0 XP.\n\nWhen your PC gains a new level, you gain access to the benefits listed in the Progression table for the class at the new level. You also gain 1 hit die and more hit points. To calculate these new hit points, roll the new hit die, add your CON modifier to the roll, and add the total to your total hit points. If you don't want to roll, you can use the average hit die value (listed in each class description) plus your CON modifier.\n\nLeveling Methods\nThe GM keeps players aware of progress toward the next level by awarding XP or by tracking milestones. The GM decides which method to use.\n\nTracking XP\nWhen a GM tracks XP, they tally up the challenges that the PCs overcame during the session and award XP for them at the end. This method is good for groups that battle lots of monsters and have clearly defined areas of challenge. The Level Advancement table details the XP you need to advance to new levels. Don't reset the XP total after each level, just keep piling it on.\n\nTracking Milestones\nWhen the GM tracks milestones, PCs level up when they achieve a specific goal established by the GM. The milestone method works well for looser, faster-paced games or player groups that focus on storytelling, as opposed to tactical combat or dungeon delving.\n\nAs a general rule, 1st-level PCs should hit a level-up milestone after a single game session. Then, 2nd-level PCs should hit a milestone after two game sessions, and 3rd-level PCs should hit a milestone after three game sessions. They should hit another milestone approximately every three sessions after that. A GM can use dramatic license to speed up or slow down milestone advancement.\n\nHit Points and Hit Dice\nYour class determines the size of your hit dice (HD), which you use to calculate your hit points (HP). Your hit point total represents your character's life force. Classes with bigger hit dice, like a d10, are more likely to survive a few hits in combat than a class with smaller hit dice, like a d6.\n\nProficiencies\nProficiencies describe what kinds of equipment you are trained to use, like armor, weapons, and tools. They also describe what kind of challenges you are best at handling, represented by skills and saves.\n\nStarting Equipment\nEach character class includes a list of starting equipment. If you are creating a 1st-level character, you get this equipment along with any equipment granted by your background.\n\nFeature Descriptions\nEach class includes descriptions of each of the features listed in the class Progression table.\n\nSubclasses\nEach class has access to a specialization of some kind—further study or training in a particular subject. These specializations are called subclasses. At the end of the class features section, you'll find some subclass options.\n\nClass Options at a Glance\n\nCLASS DESCRIPTION HIT DIE KEY ABILITY SAVE PROFICIENCIES EQUIPMENT PROFICIENCIES\nCleric Faithful casters who wield divine magic d8 WIS WIS & CHA Light and medium armor, shields, simple weapons\nFighter Hardy adventurers who excel in combat and weapon use d10 STR or DEX CON & STR/DEX All armor types, all weapon types\nRogue Cunning adventurers who rely on agility and trickery d8 DEX DEX & INT Light armor, simple weapons, martial weapons with the light property\nWizard Cerebral casters who wield arcane magic d6 INT INT & WIS None"

        "Chapter 1: Character Creation - Fighter\n\nCLASS FEATURES\nAs a fighter, you have the following class features.\n\nHIT POINTS\n- Hit Dice: 1d10 per fighter level\n- Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution (CON) modifier\n- Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your CON modifier per fighter level after 1st\n\nPROFICIENCIES\n- Armor: Light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, shields\n- Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons\n- Tools: None\n- Saves: CON, and your choice of STR or DEX\n- Skills: Choose two from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival\n\nSTARTING EQUIPMENT\nYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n- (a) chain mail or (b) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows\n- (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons\n- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes\n- (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack\n\nLAST STAND\n1st-Level Fighter Feature\nWhen you take damage that would reduce your hit points to less than half your hit point maximum (rounded down), you can use your reaction to spend 1 or more of your hit dice, up to a number equal to your proficiency bonus (PB). Immediately roll those hit dice. You regain hit points equal to the sum of all dice rolled + your CON modifier.\n\nFIGHTER PROGRESSION\nLEVEL - PB - FEATURES\n1st - +2 - Last Stand, Martial Action\n2nd - +2 - Action Surge (1/rest)\n3rd - +2 - Fighter Subclass\n4th - +2 - Improvement\n5th - +3 - Multiattack (2/Attack action)\n\nMARTIAL ACTION\n1st-Level Fighter Feature\nYour tactical expertise allows you to act quickly on the battlefield. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This bonus action can only be used to perform a Weapon Option (see Chapter 3) or one of the unique Martial Actions granted by this feature.\n\nChoose one of the following unique Martial Actions that you know. This feature grants more benefits at higher levels.\n\n1. Aim\n- Requires Wielding a Ranged Weapon\n- As a bonus action, you take the time to increase the effectiveness of your next ranged weapon attack. Select one target you can see. If you make a ranged weapon attack against that target before the end of your turn, double your PB for the first attack roll.\n\n2. Guard\n- Requires Wielding a Shield\n- As a bonus action, you raise your shield to intercept incoming attacks. Select one enemy creature within 5 feet of you. That creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against you or an ally within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn.\n\n3. Quick Strike\n- Requires Wielding Two Light Weapons\n- Once per turn, after you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand instead of the one attack typically granted by two-weapon fighting. Don't add your ability modifier to the damage of these additional attacks unless the modifier is negative.\n\n4. Wind Up\n- Requires Wielding a Two-Handed Weapon or a Versatile Weapon with Both Hands\n- As a bonus action, you take the time to increase the effectiveness of your next weapon attack. Select one target you can see within 5 feet of you. If you make a melee weapon attack against that target before the end of your turn, you double your PB for the first attack roll.\n\nACTION SURGE\n2nd-Level Fighter Feature\nWhen the need is great, you push your body to its absolute limits. On your turn, you can activate this feature to gain an additional action on top of your regular action and possible bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\n\nFIGHTER SUBCLASS\n3rd-Level Fighter Feature\nYour basic capabilities as a warrior have reached their peak. It is time to choose a discipline to focus your training. Choose a discipline from the options presented later in this section. Your discipline represents the unique techniques and maneuvers you employ in battle and gives you new features as you gain more levels in the fighter class.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n4th-Level Fighter Feature\nIncrease one ability score of your choice by 1 and choose a talent for which you meet the prerequisites from the Martial Talent list (see the Talents section later in this chapter).\n\nMULTIATTACK\n5th-Level Fighter Feature\nYour physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action.\n\nFIGHTER SUBCLASSES\nAs you develop mastery, you gain new abilities that support your preferred combat tactics. The subclass you choose represents your specialized training in pursuit of ever-greater martial might.\n\nSPELL BLADE\nFighters of the Spell Blade discipline view fighting with swords and sorcery as a logical marriage of power. For you, the arcane can be wielded as if it were a weapon, and honing your mind is just as important as honing your body.\n\nARCANE SPELLCASTING\n3rd-Level Spell Blade Feature\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you enhance your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See Spell Rules in Chapter 4 for the general rules of spellcasting and the arcane circle spell list.\n\nCantrips: You learn two cantrips of your choice from the arcane circle.\nSpell Slots: The Spell Blade Progression table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your arcane circle spells of the 1st ring and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must use a slot of the spell's ring or higher. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher: When you choose this subclass at 3rd level, you know three 1st ring arcane circle spells of your choice, two of which must be from the abjuration or evocation schools. The Spells Known column of the Spell Blade Progression table shows when you learn more arcane circle spells of the 1st ring or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice and must be of a ring for which you have spell slots. When you gain a level of fighter, you can replace one of the arcane circle spells you know with another spell of your choice from that spell list. The new spell must be of a ring for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell unless you're replacing the third spell you gained at 3rd level.\n\nSpellcasting Ability: Intelligence (INT) is your spellcasting ability for your Spell Blade spells since you learn spells through study and memorization. Use your INT whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, use your INT modifier when setting the save DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nENCHANT WEAPON\n3rd-Level Spell Blade Feature\nA crucial step on the path of the spell blade is learning to synergize weapons with your magical power. If you spend one hour of uninterrupted focus in contact with a weapon (which can be done during a rest), you can imbue that weapon with a limited form of enchantment. This enchantment lasts until you choose to end it or you use this feature to enchant a different weapon.\n\nYour enchanted weapon functions as a magic weapon with the following properties:\n- You have +1 to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. If the weapon would normally grant a magical bonus to attack and damage, your enchantment bonus stacks with the weapon's existing bonus.\n- You can use a bonus action to summon the weapon if it is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, the weapon instantly appears in your hand.\n- Creatures who handle or inspect the enchanted weapon can tell it isn't a true magic item unless the weapon was magic to begin with. Otherwise, it follows the rules of a typical magic item.\n\nEXPANDED TALENT LIST\n3rd-Level Spell Blade Feature\nWhen you gain a new talent, you can select that talent from the Martial or Magic Talent list.\n\nWEAPON MASTER\nMost fighters feel a deep connection to their weapons, but none more so than the Weapon Master. For them, a favored bow or blade is a natural extension of their body and a trusted ally against danger. Warriors who pursue the Weapon Master subclass learn to use their chosen arms with unparalleled efficiency and artistry.\n\nWEAPON MASTER PROGRESSION\nFIGHTER LEVEL - FEATURES\n3rd - Mastery, Stunts\n\nMASTERY\n3rd-Level Weapon Master Feature\nChoose three types of simple or martial weapons with which you have proficiency. You have mastered the use of those three weapons. Once per turn, when you roll damage for an attack with a weapon you have mastered, you can reroll the weapon's damage dice and use either result.\n\nSTUNTS\n3rd-Level Weapon Master Feature\nAs part of your training, you have learned to perform remarkable feats with your weapons. You gain access to special maneuvers called stunts, detailed below.\n\nTo use a stunt, you must wield a weapon that matches the weapon type listed in the stunt description (if one is listed). You can only use one stunt per turn. You gain access to new stunt options at higher levels.\n\nAll stunt options below are available to you at 3rd level. You can perform stunts a number of times equal to your PB + 1. After that, you need to finish a short or long rest to regain your full ability to perform stunts.\n\nSave DC for Stunts: Some stunts require your target to make a save to resist its effects. The save DC for these stunts is calculated as follows:\nStunt Save DC = 8 + your PB + your STR or DEX modifier (you choose which)\n\nSTUNT OPTIONS\nStunts are presented in alphabetical order.\n\n1. Arcing Strike\n- Requires a Two-Handed Weapon that Deals Slashing Damage\n- When you successfully deal damage with a weapon attack, you deal half that damage to a different target you can see within 5 feet of you.\n\n2. Cheap Shot\n- Requires a Melee Weapon\n- When you successfully hit a target with a melee weapon as part of the Attack action, you can immediately make an unarmed strike against that target as part of the same Attack action.\n\n3. Make It Count\n- When you take the Attack action, you can make a single attack with a +10 to the attack roll. You can't make additional attacks as part of that Attack action, even if a feature like Multiattack would normally allow you to do so.\n\n4. Parry\n- Requires a Melee Weapon\n- When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you hits you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take by 1d10 + your PB (to a minimum of 0 damage).\n\n5. Redirect\n- When you fail to hit a target with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to immediately reroll the attack, but you must select a different target you can see within 5 feet of the original target.\n\n6. Riposte\n- Requires a Melee Weapon that Doesn't Have the Heavy Property\n- When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you misses you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to immediately make a melee weapon attack against that creature.\n\n7. Run Through\n- Requires a Weapon that Deals Piercing Damage\n- When you successfully deal damage with a weapon attack, you deal half that damage to a different target you can see within 5 feet of the original target.\n\n8. Shifting Strike\n- Requires a Melee Weapon that Deals Slashing Damage\n- When you successfully hit a creature with a weapon as part of the Attack action, you can immediately move to a different unoccupied square within 5 feet of that target. This movement does not take up any of your move during your turn."

        "Chapter 1: Character Creation - Rogue\n\nClass Features:\nAs a rogue, you have the following class features.\n\nHit Points:\n- Hit Dice: 1d8 per rogue level\n- Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your CON modifier\n- Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your CON modifier per rogue level after 1st\n\nProficiencies:\n- Armor: Light armor\n- Weapons: Simple weapons and martial weapons with the light property\n- Tools: Thieves tools\n- Saves: DEX, INT\n- Skills: Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth\n\nStarting Equipment:\nYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n- (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword\n- (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword\n- (a) a burglar's pack, (b) a dungeoneer's pack, or (c) an explorer's pack\n- Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves' tools\n\nExpertise (1st-Level Rogue Feature):\nAt 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\n\nSneak Attack (1st-Level Rogue Feature):\nYou know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The weapon you use must have the finesse property or be a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.\n\nThieves' Cant (1st-Level Rogue Feature):\nDuring your rogue training, you learned Thieves' Cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature who knows Thieves' Cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.\n\nCunning Action (2nd-Level Rogue Feature):\nYour quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.\n\nRogue Subclass (3rd-Level Rogue Feature):\nTo distinguish yourself from common scoundrels and knaves, you cultivate a more specialized set of skills. Choose a subclass from the options presented later in this section, such as Thief or Enforcer. Your specialty grants you features at 3rd level and again at higher levels.\n\nImprovement (4th-Level Rogue Feature):\nIncrease one ability score of your choice by 1 and choose a talent for which you meet the prerequisites from the Technical Talent list.\n\nUncanny Dodge (5th-Level Rogue Feature):\nWhen an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.\n\nRogue Progression:\nLEVEL   PB    SNEAK ATTACK   FEATURES\n1st     +2    1d6            Expertise, Sneak Attack, Thieves' Cant\n2nd     +2    1d6            Cunning Action\n3rd     +2    2d6            Rogue Subclass\n4th     +2    2d6            Improvement\n5th     +3    3d6            Uncanny Dodge\n\nRogue Subclass:\nNot all rogues are criminals, but the long history of rogues working on the wrong side of the law carries forward in discussion of roguish specialties. A rogue's subclass represents the brand of skullduggery they bring to the table, typically in the context of a criminal operation.\n\nEnforcer:\nEnforcers excel at practical violence. Whether plying their trade as bounty hunters, assassins, or mercenaries, rogues of this specialty strive to make their bloody craft efficient and effective.\n\nAmbush (3rd-Level Enforcer Feature):\nDuring the first round of combat, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against any creature involved in the combat. Additionally, whenever you make a successful attack roll against a creature with the surprised condition, that attack is automatically considered a critical hit.\n\nCold-Blooded (3rd-Level Enforcer Feature):\nOnce per turn when you reduce a creature to 0 HP with a weapon attack, you can use the same weapon to immediately make a weapon attack against a different creature you can see within your weapon's range. You can't add Sneak Attack damage to this additional attack, even if circumstances would normally allow you to do so.\n\nExpanded Talent List (3rd-Level Enforcer Feature):\nWhen you gain a new talent, you can select that talent from the Martial or Technical Talent list.\n\nThief:\nAs a thief, you have a reputation for quick thinking and quicker fingers. Leave throat-cutting and con-running to lesser scoundrels, you live to liberate treasures held under lock and key. The thrill of bypassing a sealed door, complex trap, or other impassable obstacle is the true prize, followed by the payday that comes from whatever you took.\n\nFast Hands (3rd-Level Thief Feature):\nExperience has honed your skills, allowing you to accomplish precision work more quickly. In addition to its standard uses, you can now use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to do any of the following: make a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check, use thieves' tools to attempt to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.\n\nSecond-Story Work (3rd-Level Thief Feature):\nYou've never met a wall you couldn't conquer, and scaling such obstacles has become second nature. You gain a climb speed equal to your base movement speed. If you already have a climb speed when you gain this feature, it increases by 10 feet. Additionally, when you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet equal to your walking speed if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a high jump, you can leap half your walking speed. Each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In the event a STR (Athletics) check is required to clear or extend a jump, you can choose to make a DEX (Acrobatics) check instead."

The following sections are included among the traits of each lineage option.\n\nAGE\nThis notes the age when a member of the lineage grows into adulthood, and their expected lifespan. You can choose any starting age for your adventurer, but if you want to play a very young or very old character, make sure to run it by your GM.\n\nSIZE\nCharacters of most lineages are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few lineages are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall) or can choose to be Small, which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding weapons with the heavy property (see the Weapon Properties section in Chapter 3 for details).\n\nSPEED\nYour speed determines how far you can move when traveling overland and in combat.\n\nLINEAGE DESCRIPTIONS\nThese lineage options are available to adventurers.\n\nBEASTKIN LINEAGE TRAITS\nYour beastkin character has certain hereditary traits dictated by their lineage.\n\nAge. Beastkin mature far more quickly than most humanoids, reaching adulthood within 5 years. Though they may live nearly a century, some beastkin live only 20 or 30 years.\n\nSize. Beastkin are extremely diverse in weight and height, depending on their beast characteristics. Most are between 4 and 8 feet tall and Medium in size, but if your beastkin is shorter than 4 feet, your size is Small. Your weight varies depending on your beast characteristics. For example, a Medium-sized beastkin descended from bears likely weighs upward of 350 pounds, while an avian beastkin of the same size is likely to weigh 100 pounds or less. Use your judgment to find a weight that seems right.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nHeightened Senses. You have proficiency in either the Perception or Survival skill. \n\nNatural Weapons. You have claws, horns, hooves, fangs, spines, or a similar adaptation that serves as a natural weapon. Work with your GM to determine what type of natural weapon you possess and decide whether it does bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can use your natural weapon to make unarmed strikes. Then you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your STR or DEX modifier damage (chosen at character creation) of your chosen type, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n\nNatural Adaptation. You inherited one of the following unique traits, determined by your characteristics:\n\nAvian. Leathery, feathery, or gossamer wings sprout from your back or connect to your outstretched arms. You have a fly speed equal to your walking speed. You can't fly while wearing medium or heavy armor. Carrying a heavy load or a creature of your size or larger while flying reduces your speed by half.\n\nAgile. Sharp claws, cloven hooves, robust limbs, reversed joints, or suction pads on your hands and feet allow you to scrabble up trees, rock faces, and uneven surfaces with ease. You have a climb speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, you have advantage on saves made to avoid being knocked prone.\n\nAquatic. Oily fur, scales, fins, webbed hands and feet, or long, gangly limbs are common for your people. You have a swim speed equal to your walking speed. You can hold your breath for up to 20 minutes.\n\nSturdy. Powerful limbs, fat reserves, and thick hides are clear features of your origin. When you aren't wearing armor, you have a natural AC of 13 + your DEX modifier. Additionally, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.\n\nDWARF LINEAGE TRAITS\nYour dwarf character has certain hereditary traits dictated by their lineage.\n\nAge. Dwarves are physically mature around age 20, but most consider themselves young until they reach age 50. On average, they live about 350 years.\n\nSize. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and even the smallest average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nDarkvision. You have superior vision in naturally dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\nDwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saves against becoming poisoned, and you are resistant to poison damage.\n\nDwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\n\nELF LINEAGE TRAITS\nYour elf character has certain hereditary traits dictated by their lineage.\n\nAge. Although elves reach physical maturity around age 20, mental and emotional faculties reach full maturity around the age of 100. Elves can live to be 750 years old.\n\nSize. Elves range from under 5 feet to over 6 feet tall and tend toward slender builds, averaging around 110 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nHeightened Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.\n\nMagic Ancestry. You have advantage on saves against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.\n\nTrance. Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they enter a meditative trance state, remaining semiconscious for 4 hours a day. You choose whether or not you can dream while meditating. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that other creatures do from 8 hours of sleep.\n\nHUMAN LINEAGE TRAITS\nYour human character has certain hereditary traits dictated by their lineage.\n\nAge. Humans reach adulthood in their late teenage years and rarely live to be more than 100 years old.\n\nSize. Humans vary widely in height and weight, but most adults range between 5 feet and 6 feet tall, and they average around 150 pounds. If you play a human of average height, your size is Medium. If you choose to play a human shorter than 4 feet, you can choose your size to be Small.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nAmbitious. You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice, and you gain one talent of your choice. This talent can be from any of the talent lists, but you must meet the talent's prerequisites (if any are required).\n\nHERITAGE\nHeritage represents the upbringing and culture of a character. It's what your parents, community values, or other formative authority figures taught you. Example heritages include cosmopolitan (city dwellers), grove (forest denizens), and stone (undermountain folk).\n\nELEMENTS OF A HERITAGE\nHeritage dictates certain abilities you have because of your connection to a group or society. Heritage includes all manner of tangible and intangible cultural elements, such as architecture, works of art, folklore, traditions, language, and natural environment.\n\nLANGUAGES\nHeritage dictates how many languages you know. By default, all characters know the Common language and one other language, but some heritages and backgrounds allow you to choose even more. Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table or one common in your campaign. With the GM's permission, you can instead choose a language from the Esoteric Languages table or a secret language, such as Thieves' Cant or the tongue of druids. If you are unsure which language to choose, look at the suggested languages provided in each heritage option.\n\nSome of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures who speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.\n\nSTANDARD LANGUAGES\nCOMMON - Humans, Dwarves, Elves\nDWARVISH - Dwarves\nELVISH - Elves\nGIANT - Ogres, giants\nGNOMISH - Gnomes\nGOBLIN - Goblinoids\nHALFLING - Halflings\nORCISH - Orcs\n\nESOTERIC LANGUAGES\nABYSSAL - Demons\nCELESTIAL - Celestials\nDRACONIC - Dragons, dragonborn\nINFERNAL - Devils\nPRIMORDIAL - Elementals\nSYLVAN - Fey creatures\nUNDERCOMMON - Underworld traders\n\nHERITAGE OPTIONS\nThis section contains descriptions of the heritage options available to adventurers. If you're not sure or want a character that reflects common fantasy archetypes, choose a recommended heritage listed on the table below.\n\nCOMMON HERITAGES BY LINEAGE\nBEASTKIN - Slayer, Wildlands\nDWARF - Fireforge, Stone\nELF - Cloud, Grove\nHUMAN - Cosmopolitan, Nomadic\n\nCLOUD HERITAGE\nCloud heritage characters were raised with the values and traditions of the cloud elf communities.\n\nMany accounts concerning the origins of the elves have been spun, and almost all are deeply intertwined with tales of magic. In a time long lost to memory, a group of elves clung to these tales and named themselves mages, stewards of the magical forces that coursed through the cosmos. These elves were the first of the cloud elf tribes, and the towers they built to study the mysteries of the skies eventually became the hearts of thriving cities.\n\nThough many elves still dwell within these towering cities, striving for a greater understanding of magic, people from all over the world have been drawn into these cloud communities eager to study the arcane arts at the finest magic academies or simply to dwell among kindred spirits for whom magic is the center of their world.\n\nTouch of Magic. Choose a school of magic for which you have an affinity. Learn a cantrip of your choice from that school of magic. Then you reach 3rd level, choose a 1st-level spell from that same school of magic. You learn this spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast this spell, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again using this feature. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is CHA, INT, or WIS (choose which during character creation).\n\nWorld of Wonders. You have proficiency in the Arcana skill.\n\nLanguages. You know Common and two additional languages of your choice. Typical cloud heritage characters choose Elvish and Draconic.\n\nCOSMOPOLITAN HERITAGE\nCosmopolitan characters are citizens of the world whose values, interests, and ideas are influenced by exposure to many different peoples and cultures. Creatures of this heritage hail from major cities populated by people from many different parts of the world. Alternatively, it could mean you spent your formative years moving from place to place, immersing yourself in the customs and traditions of each community you lived with.\n\nStreet Smarts. While in a city or other urban environment, you have advantage on ability checks made to avoid getting lost and checks made to find a particular kind of business or other destination open to the public. Additionally, while you are in such environments, you can't be surprised unless you are asleep or otherwise incapacitated.\n\nWorldly Wisdom. When you make a check related to understanding the purpose or significance of a building, rite, or object from a culture you aren't familiar with, you can add your PB to the roll. If you have proficiency in a relevant skill or tool, add double your PB to the roll.\n\nLanguages. You know Common and two additional languages of your choice. Typical cosmopolitan heritage characters choose Dwarvish and Elvish.\n\nFIREFORGE HERITAGE\nFireforge heritage characters were raised with the values and traditions of the fireforge dwarven clans.\n\nDwarven legends are united that the best metalcrafting is done in the fires of the earth itself. Long ago, groups of dwarves following this tradition settled near areas of volcanic activity, turning such places into their forges. These dwarves were the founders of the fireforge clans. To this day, these communities toil in the heat of magma, creating weapons, armor, and goods noteworthy even among the finest dwarven crafts. They trade these goods for necessities not found in the harsh environment of their chosen settlements.\n\nExpert Artisan. You gain proficiency with smith's tools. Your PB is doubled for any ability check you make that uses them.\n\nForgecra. You are resistant to fire damage.\n\nFriend to Elementals. You can speak, read, and write Ignan in addition to your chosen languages.\n\nReforge. Your people have a deep connection with elemental fire and have learned how to repair forged items with a touch. You know the mending cantrip, and you can cast it as an action. However, you can use this trait to repair objects made only of metal, such as reconnecting two halves of a broken sword.\n\nLanguages. You know Common and one additional language of your choice. Typical fireforge heritage characters choose Dwarvish.\n\nGROVE HERITAGE\nGrove heritage characters were raised with the values and traditions of the grove elf communities.\n\nWhen elves first walked the world, many chose to settle in the bounteous forests. These were the first grove elves, who established communities that intertwined with the natural world rather than seeking dominion over it. These communities preserve the forests they call home, communing with nature in sacred groves and taking up arms against those who dare to claim ownership of the land.\n\nAs natural spaces are threatened by growing populations, all manner of creatures have come to share the values of the grove elves. All whose hearts are open to the beasts and plants of the wild are welcome to settle among them.\n\nCanopy Walker. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.\n\nElf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.\n\nLanguages. You know Common and one additional language of your choice. Typical grove heritage characters choose Elvish.\n\nNOMADIC HERITAGE\nNomadic heritage characters hail from a tight-knit community that regularly moves to and from different areas. Your people might flow with seasonally available plants and game, follow established trade routes, or roam for a more unique reason. People of nomadic heritage are suited to the rigors of travel and often understand environmental cycles and the hazards or benefits that come with them.\n\nResilient. You have advantage on checks or saves made to resist debilitating weather effects, such as those caused by extreme heat or cold. Additionally, when you complete a short rest, you can reduce your exhaustion level by one. Once used, you cannot reduce your exhaustion level in this way again until you complete a long rest.\n\nTraveler. You have proficiency in the Survival skill.\n\nLanguages. You know Common and one additional language of your choice. Depending on the regions your people frequent or the kinds of communities your people trade with, typical nomadic heritage characters choose Dwarvish or Elvish.\n\nSTONE HERITAGE\nStone heritage characters were raised with the values and traditions of the stone dwarven clans.\n\nAbove all else, the residents of the ancient cities of the stone dwarf clans value tradition and champion the deeds of ancestors who allowed their people to find safety within the earth. From infancy, people of the stone are instructed in the dwarven arts of smithing, metalworking, and masonry. Many devote their lives to mining and working precious metals beneath the surface of the world.\n\nThough members of the stone dwarf clans take pride in their society, life in their cities is far from easy. The splendid caverns and mines occupied by the stone dwarves are under constant attack by other subterranean denizens. As children are raised to swing a mining pick, they are also taught to swing arms against the enemies that seek generations of dwarven treasures for themselves.\n\nDwarven Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.\n\nTool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies, or mason's tools.\n\nEye for Quality. When you make an ability check related to the origin of metalwork or masonry, you can add your PB to the roll. If you have proficiency in a relevant skill or tool, add double your PB.\n\nLanguages. You know Common and one additional language of your choice. Typical stone heritage characters choose Dwarvish.\n\nSLAYER HERITAGE\nSlayer heritage characters were raised with the values and traditions of the beastkin slayer communities.\n\nLong ago, small packs of beastkin became entwined with dangerous fauna: tigers, bears, sharks, or scorpions to name a few. How the early beastkin survived and prospered alongside such vicious predators remains unclear, but the descendants of these beastkin, referred to as slayers, have an expert understanding of hunting, tracking, and harvesting from their environment.\n\nSlayer communities dedicate their lives to hunting other powerful predators that might topple natural ecosystems, such as dragons or trolls. Sometimes slayer packs accept coin to kill specific monsters, but more often, they purchase goods they can't make with treasures seized from monster lairs or profits made from selling harvested monster parts.\n\nGiven their dangerous lifestyle, slayer communities value strength and tracking skill. Slayers who can no longer hunt due to age, illness, or injury are honorably retired from the pack to live with non-slayer relatives. However, rumors also tell of hidden villages populated by retired slayers.\n\nFerocity. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. Any nonmagical Beast whose CR is equal to or less than your PB that targets you with an attack must first make a WIS check contested by your CHA (Intimidation). If you succeed, the beast must choose a new target or lose the attack. If you fail, it attacks normally. If you attack or deal damage to a creature, or cast a spell that affects a hostile creature, this effect ends for all Beasts that can see or hear you.\n\nTracker. When you make a check to locate, spot, or track a creature, you can add your PB to the roll. If you have proficiency in the skill or tool being used, add double your PB.\n\nLanguages. You know Common and one additional language of your choice. Typical slayer heritage characters choose Primordial.\n\nWILDLANDS HERITAGE\nWildlands heritage characters were raised with the values and traditions of the wildlands communities.\n\nIn far-flung corners of the world, wild places well up with environmental magic. Such overabundance of power might come from a mystic connection to the primal fey realms or a distant echo of a primordial spell cast long ago. This power transforms the fauna that dwell there, giving rise to wise beasts with gifts of speech and reason. They develop nature-based societies unlike those found in humanoid civilizations.\n\nMembers of these communities are raised in territories unspoiled by the trappings of civilization, where beasts and humanoids live alongside one another as equals. A wildlands community is typically composed of intelligent beasts and humanoids with beast traits like the beastkin who work together to defend the interests of all who share their characteristics. Indeed, preservation of these interests is one of the few reasons members of this heritage ever leave their territories. Whenever encroaching civilization puts a wildlands community at risk, the task of gathering information or forging diplomatic relations falls upon the more humanoid-like members of such groups.\n\nBeast Affinity. Using a combination of both gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with Beasts, and you have advantage on checks made to interact with nonhostile Beasts.\n\nShepherd's Gift. You have proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. Any nonmagical Beast whose CR is equal to or less than your PB that targets you with an attack must first make a WIS check contested by your WIS (Animal Handling). If you succeed, the beast must choose a new target or lose the attack. If you fail, it attacks normally. If you attack or deal damage to a creature, or cast a spell that affects a hostile creature, this effect ends for all Beasts that can see or hear you.\n\nLanguages. You know Common and one additional language of your choice. Typical wildlands heritage characters choose Sylvan."

        "\nCHAPTER 2: PLAYING THE GAME\nRolling the Dice\n\nMost of what happens during Black Flag  game play can be handled through conversations between the player characters (PCs) and the Game Master (GM). But whenever a PC a empts something remarkable, where there is the potential to fail, it s time to roll the dice. Your character s ability modifiers and proficiencies can increase your chances of success, along with other factors covered here. is section describes how dice rolls are used to determine success or failure. It outlines the stages of making a roll and how a roll may be affected by character capabilities or external circumstances.\n\nMAKING CHECKS\nMost dice rolls in the Black Flag Roleplaying game are checks. All checks involve rolling a 20-sided die called a d20. To make a check, roll a d20 to determine your starting number.  en add one of the ability modifiers on your character sheet. Finally, if you are proficient in something relevant to the roll, add your proficiency bonus (PB).  e total of those numbers is your check result.Check FormulaCheck Result = d20 + Ability Modifier + PB (If you have a relevant proficiency) \n\nSTAGES OF A CHECK\n   Player describes the task they want to accomplish.   GM decides if a check is needed. If not, play continues. If a check is needed, proceed to next step.   GM declares what kind of check is needed, including which ability modifier it uses and what proficiencies  are relevant.\u000e   GM determines if the check is being made with advantage or disadvantage.   Player rolls a d20 (or two d20s if they have advantage or disadvantage).   Player adds their ability modifier and PB (if they have a relevant proficiency) to the number rolled to determine their check result.   If desired, a PC spends Luck points to increase the check result.   GM compares the check result to the check DC and declares whether the check succeeds or fails.\n\nABILITY MODIFIERS\nAll checks in the game are tied to one of the six ability modifiers Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Wisdom (WIS), Intelligence (INT), or Charisma (CHA). You add one of these six ability modifiers to every check.  e rules typically dictate which modifier you must use for a particular check, but in cases where no ability is listed, the GM decides which one is relevant. For more information about applying ability modifiers to checks, see the  ich Ability Modifier? sidebar.\n\nPROFICIENCY BONUS\nAll PCs have a proficiency bonus determined by their level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. Only add your PB to a die roll or DC once. For example, if two different rules allow you to add your PB to a WIS save, you may add it only once.Occasionally, you might double or halve your PB before you add it. If some circumstance suggests that your PB applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and double or halve it only once.If your PB doesn t apply to a roll, doubling doesn t change that. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your PB when you make INT (History) checks.29 Chaptier 2: Playing the GameIn general, don t double your PB for a ack rolls or saves.  en you have advantage or disadvantage and a rule lets If some feature or effect allows you to do so, the above rules  you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You still apply. choose which one. For example, if you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and roll a 1 and a 13, you DETERMINING SUCCESS OR FAILUREcould reroll the 1 or the 13, but not both.You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the In most cases, you measure your check result against a  use of special abilities, actions, or spells. You can also use target number the GM sets for you, called a difficulty class  Luck points to grant advantage. Finally, the GM can decide (DC). If your check result is equal to or higher than the  that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the DC, your roll succeeds! If it s less than the DC, you fail.other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a DETERMINING DC situational call.Black Flag Roleplaying30Most of the time, the rules tell the GM what a DC should be. For example, a PC must get a check result of 19 or higher to successfully a ack a creature with an AC 19 (AC is one example of a pre-determined DC). en the rules don t provide a DC, the GM gets to set an appropriate number. If you re the GM and you aren t sure, think about how hard you want a task to be.  en consult the Typical Difficulty Class table to assign a number. You can always set it at a number that isn t divisible by 5.\n\nTYPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASS\n\n\nDIFFICULTY DC\nHigh Chance of Success 10 or less Moderate Chance of Success                          15Low Chance of Success 20 Almost No Chance of Success                         25 or higher\n\n\u000eLUCK\nEvery PC has a special resource called Luck. Use Luck to influence the result of any ability check, a ack roll, or save you make.\n\nSPENDING LUCK POINTS\nSpend Luck points on a 1-for-1 bonus to add to any d20 roll you make. For example, if you have 4 Luck points, and roll a 13 on the die, you could spend 2 Luck points and make your result a 15. You then have 2 Luck points to use later. You can t use Luck points to offset the effects of rolling a natural 1 or create the effects of a natural 20. No one is that lucky.Alternatively, immediately a er you make an ability check, a ack roll, or save, you can spend 3 Luck points to reroll a single d20 used for that roll.Black Flag Roleplaying30\n\nADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGEGAINING LUCK POINTS\nSometimes special circumstances allow you to roll a  en you create your character, you start with 0 Luck check with advantage or force you to roll a check with  points. You gain Luck points in the following ways: disadvantage.    Once per turn, when you fail an a ack roll or save, gain Rolling with advantage means you roll two d20s, then  1 Luck point. use the higher of the two numbers to calculate your check    e GM can award 1 Luck point to a character as a result.  reward for coming up with a clever idea, excellent Rolling with disadvantage means you roll two d20s,   roleplaying, or trying something interesting but not then use the lower of the two numbers to calculate your  optimal.check result.    e GM can award Luck points to a party for surviving For example, if you have advantage and roll a 17 and a 5,  difficult encounters or achieving story goals (in you use the 17.

Same goes for  LOSING LUCK POINTSdisadvantage. You only ever roll a maximum of two d20s.A PC may have a maximum of 5 Luck points at one time. If If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and your PC has 5 Luck points and would gain a sixth, you must disadvantage, they cancel each other out, and you roll only immediately roll a d4 and reset your Luck points to the die one d20.  is works no ma er how many circumstances result.impose disadvantage or grant advantage. If they conflict at all, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.Black Flag Roleplaying30\n\nTHE THREE TYPES OF CHECKS\nBlack Flag  rules have three types of checks. All use the same core mechanics described in the Making Checks section, but each is used in different circumstances and has different rules around whether you add your PB to the check result. Each type of check is described in greater detail here.\n\nATTACK ROLLS\nA ack rolls are checks used almost exclusively during combat for a acking. For a full rundown on a ack rolls, refer to the Combat section later in this chapter.\n\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\nIf you have proficiency with the weapon you re using (simple or martial), add your PB to the a ack roll.\n\nSAVES\nSaves are checks made to resist or avoid threats from spells, traps, poisons, diseases, or similar hazards. You don t normally decide to make a save; the GM asks you to make one because your character is at risk of harm.To make a save, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For instance, use your DEX modifier for a DEX save. e DC for a save is determined by the effect that calls for it. As an example, when you make a save against a spell, the DC is determined by the caster s spellcasting ability and PB. e result of a successful or failed save is described in the effect a er its DC.A successful save usually means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\n\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\nYour character class gives you proficiency in at least two saves based on which ability modifiers are useful for the class.  e wizard, for example, is proficient in INT and WIS saves. Add your PB to saves according to your class.\n\nABILITY CHECKS\n en you want to do something that isn t covered by an a ack roll or save, make an ability check. Since ability checks cover a wide range of tasks, they are slightly more complex than the other two types of checks.To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success. You overcome the challenge. Otherwise, it s a failure. You make no progress toward the objective, or you make some progress but also suffer a setback, as determined by the GM.\n\n\u000eCONTESTS\nSometimes your efforts are directly opposed by someone else.  is can occur when multiple creatures try to do the same thing but only one can succeed, such as snatching a magic ring falling to the floor. It can also occur when one creature tries to prevent another one from accomplishing a goal for example, a monster might try to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.Every participant in a contest makes an ability check. Apply appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, compare the check results.  e participant with the highest check result wins the contest and either succeeds at the action or prevents other participants from succeeding.If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same.  us, one participant might win by default. If two creatures tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep it closed, a tie means that the door stays shut.\n\nPASSIVE CHECKS\nA passive check doesn t involve any die rolls.  is kind of ability check can represent an average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again. Or a GM can use it to secretly determine whether a PC succeeds at something the player doesn t know to try to do, such as noticing a hidden monster.A passive check total is called a score. Here s how to determine a character s passive score:   10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check.   If the character has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. So, for example, if a 1st-level character has a WIS +2 ability modifier and is proficient in the Perception skill, they have a passive Perception score of 14 (10 + 2 for WIS + 2 for PB).\n\nWORKING TOGETHER\nSometimes two or more creatures team up on a job.  e creature with the highest ability modifier is designated the lead for the effort.  at creature can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help given by the others. In combat, this requires the Help action.A creature can only provide help if they have capacity to do the task. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves  tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can t work together on a lock-picking job. Moreover, a character can help only when their assistance would be productive.  reading a needle doesn t get any easier with another pair of hands.31 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n\nGROUP CHECKS\n en a number of individuals try to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group check. In this case, characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren t.To make a group check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the members succeed (round up), the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.Group checks don t come up o en, and they re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers navigate a swamp, the GM might call for a WIS (Survival) group check to see if the whole party can avoid quicksand, sinkholes, and other hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters can guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into a hazard.\n\nRELEVANT PROFICIENCIES\nTwo main types of proficiencies can modify an ability check.Tool ProficienciesA tool helps you do something you couldn t otherwise do, such as repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents can give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your PB to any ability check you make using that tool.Tool use is not tied to a single ability modifier.  e check depends on what you re trying to do, at the GM s discretion. For example, when using woodcarver s tools, the GM might ask you to make a DEX check to carve out fine detail or a STR check to make something out of particularly hard wood.Skill ProficienciesEvery PC starts the game with skill proficiencies granted by their background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents. Proficiency in a skill means you can add your PB to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, you don t add your PB to ability checks.For example, if a character a empts to climb a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a STR (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the player rolls a d20, adds their character s STR modifier and then adds PB. If the character lacks that proficiency, the player rolls a d20 and adds only their character s STR modifier. e rules in a scenario usually prompt a GM to ask for an ability check using a specific skill for example,  Make a WIS (Perception) check.  Sometimes though, more than one skill might reasonably apply to a situation. A player can ask the GM if a different skill is relevant to the check. If the GM agrees, the PC can try a skill they re more proficient in!\n\n\u000eSKILL DESCRIPTIONS\n e skill descriptions here explain the different ways you can use the skill.\n\nACROBATICS\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX)Your DEX (Acrobatics) check covers your a empt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as running across a sheet of ice, balancing on a tightrope, or staying upright on a rocking ship s deck.  e GM might also call for a DEX (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\n\nANIMAL HANDLING\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS) en you want to calm a domesticated animal, keep a mount from ge ing spooked, or intuit an animal s intentions, the GM might call for a WIS (Animal Handling) check. You also make a WIS (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you try something risky.\n\nARCANA\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)Your INT (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and inhabitants of those planes.\n\nATHLETICS\nAssociated Ability: Strength (STR)Your STR (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include:Climbing a sheer or slippery cliff, avoiding hazards while scaling a wall, or clinging to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.Jumping an unusually long distance or pulling off a stunt midjump.Swimming or staying afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or a creature tries to pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\n\nDECEPTION\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA)Your CHA (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, verbally or through your actions.  is deception ranges from misleading through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, cheat at gambling, wear a convincing disguise, dull suspicions with false assurances, or smile genuinely while telling a complete whopper.Black Flag Roleplaying32\n\nHISTORY\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)Your INT (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\n\nINSIGHT\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)Your WIS (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone s next move.  is involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\n\nINTIMIDATION\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA) en you a empt to influence someone through threats, hostility, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a CHA (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down, or using a broken bo le to suggest that a sneering vizier reconsider.\n\nINVESTIGATION\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT) en you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an INT (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an INT (Investigation) check.\n\nMEDICINE\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)A WIS (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\n\nNATURE\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)Your INT (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\n\nPERCEPTION\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS)Your WIS (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to overhear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or catch the scent of monsters moving stealthily through the forest. You might also try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, such as orcs lying \u000ein ambush, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA)Your CHA (Performance) check determines how well you delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or other forms of entertainment.\n\nPERSUASION\nAssociated Ability: Charisma (CHA) en you a empt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask for a CHA (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use Persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etique e. Examples include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\n\nRELIGION\nAssociated Ability: Intelligence (INT)Your INT (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\n\nSLEIGHT OF HAND\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX) enever you a empt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting an item on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check.  e GM might also call for a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you li  a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person s pocket.\n\nSTEALTH\nAssociated Ability: Dexterity (DEX)Make a DEX (Stealth) check when you a empt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\n\nSURVIVAL\nAssociated Ability: Wisdom (WIS) e GM might ask you to make a WIS (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.33 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n\nHIDING \nThe GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you attempt to hide, make a DEX (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or stop hiding, that check result is contested by the Perception score of a creature who might discover you.You can’t attempt to hide from a creature that can sense you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.A creature with the invisible condition (see Appendix) can always attempt to hide and has advantage on DEX (Stealth) checks to do so. In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it typically senses you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a distracted creature, granting you advantage on an attack roll (see Unseen Attackers and Targets in the Combat section of this chapter).Perception Score. In a monster or NPC stat block, each creature has a Perception score. Whether a monster is actively searching for you or just going about their business, the GM compares your DEX (Stealth) check result to the creature’s Perception score to see whether they notice you.What Can You See? A big factor in determining whether you can find something is how well you can see. Visibility in an area could be lightly or heavily obscured (see Vision and Light in the Adventuring section of this chapter)."

        "Black Flag Roleplaying\n\nBackgrounds\n\nBackground helps define your character's personal history (also called backstory) before taking up the mantle of an adventurer. When choosing a background, consider how it plays into your character's heritage and class. Did your life as a soldier naturally pave the way for you to become a fighter? Did a religious experience pull you away from a community that holds a different faith? Your choice of background gives you access to additional proficiencies, talents, equipment, and other benefits like additional languages.\n\nELEMENTS OF A BACKGROUND\n\nThis section explains the various aspects of a background.\n\nSKILL PROFICIENCIES\n\nEach background gives a character proficiency in two skills. If your character would already gain the same skill proficiency from their class, lineage, or heritage features, you can choose a different skill proficiency instead.\n\nADDITIONAL PROFICIENCES OR LANGUAGES\n\nMost backgrounds grant proficiency with one or more tools (see the Adventuring Gear and Tools section in Chapter 3) or allow a character to learn additional languages.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nEach background provides a package of starting equipment.\n\nTALENT\n\nEach background allows a character to choose one talent from a short list of options. These options are typically a mix from all three talent lists, so they represent a unique opportunity to grab a talent from a list your class may not have access to in the future.\n\nADVENTURING MOTIVATION\n\nA background contains suggested motivations to help inform your reasons for becoming an adventurer. You can roll to determine it randomly, pick one off the list, or use the suggestions as inspiration for creating your own motivation.\n\nADHERENT\n\nYou devoted yourself to furthering a singular focus in your life, be it a faith, belief, or cause. In the service of a god, priests may have tasked you with daily prayers, holy rites, and the recitation of sacred scripture. As an adherent of a secret society, you may have taken part in special initiations, cryptic ceremonies, or ritualistic sacrifice. Aending to these exacting procedures has ingrained a sense of duty and purpose within you which only a few may understand.\n\nPerhaps you are a hopeful inductee into the clergy of a war god, a recently excommunicated priest of a fiend-worshipping sect, or a lifelong member of a secret society in which your siblings can be found across the globe. No matter how you came to adventuring, you carry the teachings and traditions of your devotion with you every step of the way.\n\nSkill Proficiencies: Choose two from History, Investigation, Religion, or Persuasion.\n\nAdditional Proficiencies: Gain proficiency with calligrapher's supplies and one type of tool or instrument of your choice.\n\nEquipment: A prayer book or ceremonial dagger, a reliquary (holy symbol), a block of fragrant incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp.\n\nTALENT\n\nAs an adherent, you have devoted yourself to an array of highly specific tasks and teachings known only to your order, each of which commands mental and emotional precision. Choose a talent from the following list to represent this experience: Field Medic, Mental Fortitude, or Ritualist.\n\nADVENTURING MOTIVATION\n\nMany adherents do not stray far from the object of their devotion. Those who roam often do so for reasons specific to their order. When you begin your adventures, consider what has tempted or called you to step away from the safety of your order into the unknown.\n\nd8 ADVENTURING MOTIVATION\n1 Adventuring lets me test the limits of my devotion.\n2 Adventuring allows me to learn about and report on other religions and orders.\n3 Adventuring allows me to practice more unorthodox methods of worship.\n4 Adventuring is a way to find others sworn to my order.\n5 Adventuring allows me to share my faith with heretics, pagans, and the uninitiated.\n6 Adventuring brings glory and notoriety to my order.\n7 Adventuring furnishes me with the tithe my order deserves.\n8 Adventuring keeps me from being dragged back to the ord from which I narrowly escaped.\n\nOUTCAST\n\nA petty criminal, victim of ill fortune, or waif left to suffer on the fringe of civilization, you have spent your life surviving on scraps and taking what you can. Eking out a living on the compassionless streets has left you on the wrong side of the law but instilled skills and instincts to survive, overcome, and prosper in the darkest corners of any city.\n\nPerhaps you are an urchin chased from your old stomping grounds, a pickpocket trying to make ends meet, or a reformed bandit trying to make amends. Whatever your circumstances, the thrills, exigencies, and misfortunes of life outside the law will never leave you.\n\nSkill Proficiencies: Choose two from Deception, Insight, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.\n\nAdditional Proficiencies: You gain proficiency with one type of game set and one of the following: a disguise kit, a poisoner's kit, or thieves' tools.\n\nEquipment: A dark cloak and a set of dark common clothes, a silver coin given to you by a kind stranger, and a pouch containing 10 gp.\n\nTALENT\n\nAs an outcast, you have developed skills and physical abilities to survive a life on the streets. Choose a talent from the following list to represent this experience: Aware, Hand to Hand, or Touch of Luck.\n\nADVENTURING MOTIVATION\n\nOutcasts like you are familiar with the hardships adventurers face on their travels, but think about how your own history of such hardship shapes your relationships and reasons to travel to unfamiliar places. When you begin your adventures, consider why you chose or were forced to exchange a life of familiarity and criminal enterprise for a life of exploration and bravura.\n\nd8 ADVENTURING MOTIVATION\n1 Adventuring is a way to stay ahead of the law, I hope.\n2 Adventuring is how I'll finally earn (or seize) my fortune.\n3 Adventuring is a way to amass power and influence before my inevitable return home.\n4 Adventuring is how I'll make amends for a life of wrongdoing.\n5 Adventuring is a way to master my skills without fear of ending up in a cell.\n6 Adventuring is a way to make a name for myself that will be feared and respected.\n7 Adventuring is how I'll track down the person who ruined my life.\n8 Adventuring is a way to find a crew I can trust.\n\nSCHOLAR\n\nWhether enrolled in an institution of learning or apprenticed to a distinguished sage, you spent years researching a branch of study. Time spent in academic pursuits has honed your mind, allowing you to view the world through an intellectual lens afforded to few.\n\nPerhaps you are a new graduate eager to learn more of the world, a retired teacher ready for new adventures, or a discredited researcher driven to prove your theories. Regardless, your way has always been lit by your keen mind and driven by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.\n\nSkill Proficiencies: Choose two from Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.\n\nAdditional Proficiencies: Learn two additional languages of your choice or gain proficiency with one type of tool or vehicle relevant to your field of study.\n\nEquipment: A bottle of ink, a quill, a small knife, a reference book on a highly specific subject of your choice, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp.\n\nTALENT\n\nAs a scholar, you have spent time researching particular academic subjects at an institute of learning or under a knowledgeable teacher. Choose a talent from the following list to represent this experience: Polyglot, School Specialization, or Trade Skills.\n\nADVENTURING MOTIVATION\n\nMost scholars happily spend their lives cloistered within libraries, laboratories, and workshops, immersed in academia. When you begin your adventures, consider why you chose or were driven to leave the comforts of a traditional lifestyle to heed the call of the unknown.\n\nd8 ADVENTURING MOTIVATION\n1 Adventuring supplies me with coin to fund my research.\n2 Adventuring is how I'll gain field experience relevant to my field of study.\n3 Adventuring is a way to actually experience and see the knowledge not found within typical institutions.\n4 Adventuring is the best way to collect data for my patron or employer.\n5 Adventuring is a way to uncover lost or forbidden knowledge.\n6 Adventuring is a way to share my expertise with others and educate them.\n7 Adventuring may lead me to the answers I desperately seek.\n8 Adventuring is a way to escape a life of academia I never wanted.\n\nSOLDIER\n\nWhether in a state military or tasked with defending a community, you have spent a significant portion of time risking your life to defend others. Surviving such dangerous work demands rigorous training, discipline, and sacrificing comforts that most people take for granted.\n\nPerhaps you are a veteran searching for a new purpose, a deserter running from the atrocities of war, or a fresh-faced patriot pursuing new ways to fight for your cause. Whatever course you took, you forever bear the weight of duty.\n\nSkill Proficiencies: Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Medicine, or Survival.\n\nAdditional Proficiencies: Gain proficiency with land or water vehicles and one tool of your choice.\n\nEquipment: A symbol of rank (like a letter, badge, or identification tags), a mess kit, a pack of playing cards or a set of dice, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp.\n\nTALENT\n\nAs a soldier, you have received special training or honed natural capabilities that kept you safe during your service. Choose a talent from the following list to represent this experience: Combat Casting, Combat Conditioning, or Field Medic.\n\nADVENTURING MOTIVATION\n\nAs a soldier, you are accustomed to the dangers and demands of an adventurer's lifestyle, but you must consider how your military responsibilities have altered to accommodate your new path. When you begin your adventures, consider why your duties as a soldier have ended or changed to allow for less-regimented pursuits.\n\nd8 ADVENTURING MOTIVATION\n1 Adventuring is a way to support myself after being dishonorably discharged from service.\n2 Adventuring is a way to continue fighting, even though the war is over.\n3 Adventuring is a way to keep protecting others, since those I used to protect are now gone.\n4 Adventuring is a way to use the skills I learned in military training without having to give my life to the military.\n5 Adventuring is a way to perform special missions for those I serve.\n6 Adventuring is a way to take justice into my own hands without concern for policy or politics.\n7 Adventuring is the return to action I've craved since my retirement.\n8 Adventuring is a way to keep my skills sharp before I can return to duty."

        "Adventuring is a section that covers the various rules that come with exploring the world and some important ways PCs interact with the environment.\n\nTIME\nIn the passage of time matters, the GM determines how long a task takes. Talking about the passage of time depends on what characters are trying to do and where they're trying to do it. In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time in which every participant gets a turn. In a dungeon environment, outside of combat, movement more often happens on a scale of minutes. It might take a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good 10 minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable. In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time. For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road between cities, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey. A GM should always feel free to shift between these scales to match what's happening in the game and to keep things moving at the table.\n\nMOVEMENT AND TRAVEL\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope – all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures. The GM can summarize movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\" Sometimes though, it's important to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. Rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.\n\nSPEED\nEvery creature has a speed, the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in a life-threatening situation. When the situation is less dire, the following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nTRAVEL PACE\nWhile traveling, a party can move at a fast, normal, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far they can move in a period of time for their pace and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully. Forced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push beyond that limit at the risk of exhaustion. For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a CON save at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed save, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see Appendix). Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is rare except in densely populated areas. Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n\nTRAVEL PACE\n\n\n                DISTANCE TRAVELED PER . . . \n\n\n                PACE MINUTE HOUR DAY                                         EFFECT\n−5 penalty to Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles Perception score Normal        300 feet        3 miles     24 miles        —Slow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles Able to use Stealth\n\nDIFFICULT TERRAIN\nThe travel speeds given on the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. However, adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground – all considered difficult terrain. You move at half speed in difficult terrain – moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed – so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nSPECIAL TYPES OF MOVEMENT\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\n\nCLIMBING, SWIMMING, AND CRAWLING\nWhile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful STR (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful STR (Athletics) check.\n\nJUMPING\nYour STR determines how far you can jump. Long Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to half your walking speed if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. Then you make a standing long jump, you can leap only a quarter of your walking speed. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At the GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 STR (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it. When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone. High Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your STR modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. Then you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a STR (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can. You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1/2 times your height. \n\nFALLING\nA fall from a great height is a common hazard for an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature lands prone and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell to a maximum of 20d6 unless it has a feature or ability that allows it to avoid taking damage from the fall.\n\nSUFFOCATING\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its CON modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its CON modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. For example, a creature with a CON modifier of +2 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\n\nVISION AND LIGHT\nThe fundamental tasks of adventuring – noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few – rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance. A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on WIS (Perception) checks that rely on sight. A heavily obscured area, such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage, blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see Appendix) when trying to see something in that area. The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness. Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days can provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light. Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical darkness.\n\nDARKVISION\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\nKEENSENSE\nA creature with keensense can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as Oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\n\nTRUESIGHT\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saves against them, and perceive the true form of a creature with the shapechanger tag or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\n\nFOOD AND WATER\nCharacters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see Appendix). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\n\nFOOD\nA character needs one pound of food per day. You can make food last longer by eating half rations. Eating half rations in a day counts as half a day without food. A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + CON modifier (minimum 1). Beyond that, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of each day. One normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\n\nWATER\nA character needs one gallon of water per day or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. If the character already has at least one level of exhaustion, the character suffers two levels each day with little or no water.\n\nINTERACTING WITH OBJECTS\nA character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what if anything happens. For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a STR check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task (see Determining DC earlier in this chapter). Characters can also damage objects with weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison damage, but otherwise, they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object's AC and HP and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks – it's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example. Objects always fail STR and DEX saves, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. Then an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks. A character can also attempt a STR check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\n\nSTATISTICS FOR OBJECTS\nGiven enough time, it's safe to assume that a PC can (and will) destroy most breakable objects. In these cases, the GM decides what a PC can reasonably accomplish. For example, it is reasonable to say a fighter can never cut through a stone wall with a sword but can chop a candle in half in the time it takes to talk about it. However, when time is a factor – like cutting through the ropes of a bridge before a horde of angry goblins charges across – giving objects some statistics helps everyone understand what's achievable. In these situations, use the following rules to determine an object's armor class and hit points. Armor Class. An object's AC is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object by striking it. The object can't dodge, but its AC represents its material resilience. The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\n\nOBJECT ARMOR CLASS\n\n\n SUBSTANCE                     AC                      SUBSTANCE               AC\nCloth, paper, rope 11 Iron, steel 19 Crystal, glass, ice         13                    Mithral               21Wood, bone 15 Adamantine 23 Stone                       17\n\nINTERACTING WITH OBJECTS AROUND YOU\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of things you can do during your move or your action:• Draw or sheathe a sword• Open or close a door• Get a potion from your backpack• Pick up a dropped weapon• Take a bauble from a table• Remove a ring from your finger• Stuff some food into your mouth• Plant a banner in the ground• Fish a few coins from your belt pouch• Drink all the ale in a flagon• Throw a lever or a switch• Pull a torch from a sconce• Extinguish a small flame• Don a mask• Pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head• Put your ear to a door• Kick a small stone• Turn a key in a lock• Tap the floor with a 10-foot pole• Hand an item to another character\n\nHit Points. An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Whether an object is fragile or resilient is up to the GM. Large objects tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking any small part of it breaks the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit point amounts for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\n\nOBJECT HIT POINTS\n\n\n SIZE                                                 FRAGILE         RESILIENT\nTiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4) Small (chest, lute)                               3 (1d6)        10 (3d6)Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8) Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window)             5 (1d10)       27 (5d10)Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, though it might be simpler to decide how long the object can withstand whatever force is acting against it and track 37 Chaptier 2: Playing the Gamethat. If you do track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections and track each section separately. Destroying a smaller section could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 HP.\n\nObjects and Damage Types. Objects are immune to poison damage. You might decide some damage types are more or less effective against a particular object or substance. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire. As always, use good judgment and let the GM make the call.\n\nDamage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold ignores any single attack that deals damage less than its damage threshold. For example, if a wall has a damage threshold of 10, attacks that deal 9 or less damage to it deal no damage at all.\n\nRESTING\nHeroic though they might be, adventurers need rest time to sleep, eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. Adventurers can take short rests during an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.\n\nSHORT REST\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. You can spend one or more hit dice at the end of a short rest, up to your maximum number of hit dice (which is equal to your character's level). For each hit die spent in this way, roll the die and add your character's CON modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional hit die after each roll. You regain some spent hit dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.\n\nLONG REST\nA long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity – at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity – the character must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, you regain all lost hit points. You also regain spent hit dice, up to half of your maximum (minimum of 1). For example, if your character has 8 hit dice, you regain 4 of them upon finishing a long rest. A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits."

        "Combat\n\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting.  e game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a ba le takes a turn.  e order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when all participants PCs and monsters alike roll initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\n\nSURPRISE\nA band of adventurers quietly sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to a ack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until it engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the ba le gains surprise over the other. e GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the DEX (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the Perception score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn t notice a threat has the surprised condition at the start of the encounter.If you re surprised, you can t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren t.\n\nINITIATIVE\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat.  en combat starts, every participant makes a DEX check to determine their place in the initiative order.  e GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time. e GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest DEX check result to the one with the lowest.  is is called initiative order, and the GM follows it to determine when each participant acts during each round. Initiative order remains the same from round to round.If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.  e GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.Black Flag Roleplaying38\n\nYOUR TURN\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed  sometimes called your walking speed is noted on your character sheet. e most common actions you can take are described in the Actions in Combat section in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action. e Movement and Position section in this chapter gives more detailed rules for your move.You don t have to move, take an action, or do anything at all on your turn. If you can t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in Actions in Combat.\n\nBONUS ACTIONS\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action.  e Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a class feature, spell, or other special ability states that you can do something as a bonus action. Otherwise, you don t have a bonus action to take.You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action s timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to take an action also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\n\nREACTIONS\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger, which can occur on your turn or on someone else s.  e opportunity a ack is the most common type of reaction. en you take a reaction, you can t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature s turn, that creature can continue its turn right a er the reaction.\n\n\u000eOTHER ACTIVITY ON YOUR TURN\nYour turn can include a variety of minor flourishes that don t require your action or your move. Some pointers:   You can communicate at any time through brief talking and gestures.   You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move, or you could draw your weapon as part of your A ack action.   If you want to interact with a second object, you need to commit your action to it.   Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions. e GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\n\nMOVEMENT AND POSITION\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, o en using movement and position to gain the upper hand.On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as li le of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming.  ese different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can be your entire move. However you move, deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\n\nBREAKING UP YOUR MOVE\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some speed before and then the remainder a er your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.39 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n\nCOMBAT STEP BY STEP\n1. Determine surprise.

Repeat step 4 until away and in what direction. the fighting stops.39 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n\nMOVING BETWEEN ATTACKS\nIf your action involves more than one weapon a ack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between a acks. For example, a fighter who can make two a acks with the Multia ack feature and has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an a ack, move 15 feet, and then a ack a different target.\n\nUSING DIFFERENT SPEEDS\nIf you have more than one speed, such as a walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between them during your move.  enever you switch, subtract the distance you ve already moved from the new speed.  e result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can t use the new speed during the current move.For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet. If you wanted to walk any farther, you d be done for your move, but you could still leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\n\nDIFFICULT TERRAIN\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases the se ing of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot.  is rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain.  e space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.\n\nBEING PRONE\nCombatants o en find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in the Appendix.You can drop prone freely, without using any speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can t stand up if you don t have enough movement le  or if your speed is 0.To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\n\n\u000eMOVING AROUND OTHER CREATURES\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature s space. You can only move through a hostile creature s space if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature s space is difficult terrain for you. ether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can t willingly end your move in its space.If you leave a hostile creature s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity a ack.\n\nFLYING MOVEMENT\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held alo  by magic, such as by the fly spell.\n\nCREATURE SIZE\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space.  e Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat.Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\n\nSIZE CATEGORIES\n\n\nSIZE SPACE\nTiny 2½ by 2½ ft. Small                5 by 5 ft.Medium 5 by 5 ft. Large                10 by 10 ft. Huge 15 by 15 ft. Gargantuan           20 by 20 ft. or larger\n\nSPACE\nA space is the area in feet that a creature effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn t 5 feet wide, for example, but in a fight, it controls that space. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.A creature s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there s li le room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.Black Flag Roleplaying40\n\nSQUEEZING INTO A SMALLER SPACE\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it.  us, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that s only 5 feet wide.  ile squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on a ack rolls and DEX saves. A ack rolls against the creature have advantage while it s squeezing.\n\nACTIONS IN COMBAT\n en you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have their own distinct actions in their stat blocks. en you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\n\nATTACK\n e most common action in combat is the A ack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.With this action, you make one melee or ranged a ack. See the Making an A ack section later in this chapter for rules that govern a acks.Certain features, such as the fighter s Multia ack, allow you to make more than one a ack with this action.\n\nCAST A SPELL\nSpellcasting characters, such as clerics and wizards, and some monsters can take the Cast a Spell action to cast a spell in combat. You can only cast spells this way if the spell has a casting time of 1 action. If a spell s casting time is longer than an action (minutes or hours) or a reaction, you can t take this action to cast it.\n\nDASH\n en you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn.  e increase equals your speed, a er applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn with a Dash.\n\nDISENGAGE\n en you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn t provoke opportunity a acks for the rest of the turn.\n\n\u000eDODGE\n en you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding a acks. Until the start of your next turn, you make DEX saves with advantage and a ack rolls made against you have disadvantage if you can see the a acker. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in the Appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.\n\nHELP\n en you take the Help action, you lend aid to another creature to complete a task.  at creature gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.You can also take the Help action to aid a friendly creature a ack a target within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or otherwise team up to make your ally s a ack more effective. If your ally a acks the target before your next turn, they get advantage on their first a ack roll.\n\nHIDE\n en you take the Hide action, you make a DEX (Stealth) check in an a empt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the Unseen A ackers and Targets section in this chapter.\n\nREADY\n en you take the Ready action, you prepare to do something on another creature s turn using your reaction.  is lets you get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. You must take your readied reaction before the start of your next turn.First, name a perceivable circumstance that triggers your reaction.  en, state the action or move you will take in response to that trigger. Examples include,  If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I ll pull the lever that opens it,  and  If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.  en the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right a er the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.You can ready a spell with the Ready action. You cast it as normal but hold its energy.  en, a er the trigger, you release it with your reaction. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding the energy requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends. Furthermore, if you take damage before you release the readied magic missile, your concentration might be broken.41 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n\nSEARCH\n en you take the Search action, you devote your a ention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a WIS (Perception) check or an INT (Investigation) check.\n\nUSE AN OBJECT\n en you take the Use an Object action, you focus specifically on that interaction. Since you can normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as drawing a sword as part of an a ack, this action is usually only needed when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn. If an object is complex or requires an ability check to use, the GM might require this action even if it s the only object you ve handled this turn.\n\nMAKING AN ATTACK\n ether you re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an a ack roll as part of a spell, an a ack has a simple structure.1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your a ack s range: a creature, an object, or a location.2. Determine modifiers.  e GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your a ack roll.3. Resolve the a ack. You make the a ack roll. On a hit, you roll damage unless the particular a ack has rules that specify otherwise. Some a acks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.If there s ever any question whether something you re doing counts as an a ack, the rule is simple: if you re making an a ack roll, you re making an a ack.\n\nATTACK ROLLS\n en you make an a ack, your a ack roll determines whether the a ack hits or misses. To make an a ack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the check result equals or exceeds the target s AC, the a ack hits. ( e AC for an NPC or monster is in its stat block.)\n\nMODIFIERS TO THE ROLL\n en a PC makes an a ack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character s PB.  en a monster makes an a ack roll, it uses the modifier provided for the action in its stat block.Ability Modifier.  e ability modifier for a melee weapon a ack is STR, and the ability modifier for a ranged weapon a ack is DEX. Weapons with the finesse or thrown property break this rule; see weapon property descriptions in chapter 3 for more on that.Some spells also require an a ack roll.  e ability \u000emodifier used for a spell a ack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.Proficiency Bonus. Add your proficiency bonus to your a ack roll when you a ack using a weapon with which you have proficiency and any time you a ack with a spell.\n\nROLLING 1 OR 20\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.If the d20 roll for an a ack is a 20, the a ack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target s AC.  is is called a critical hit. See Critical Hits later in the chapter for more on this.If the d20 roll for an a ack is a 1, the a ack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target s AC.\n\nUNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS\nCombatants can try to escape notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness. en you a ack a target you can t see, you have disadvantage on the a ack roll.  is is true whether you re guessing at the target s location or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, though the GM might just say that you missed, not whether you guessed the target s location correctly. en a creature can t see you, you have advantage on a ack rolls against it. If you are hidden both unseen and unheard when you make an a ack, you give away your location when the a ack hits or misses.\n\nCOVER\nWalls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target benefits from cover only when an a ack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. ere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective cover applies. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and DEX saves. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body.  e obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and DEX saves. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle.  e obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.A target with total cover can t be targeted directly by an a ack or a spell, although some spells can reach a target with total cover by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.Black Flag Roleplaying42\n\nRANGED ATTACKS\n en you make a ranged a ack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged a ack.\n\nRANGE\nYou can make ranged a acks only against targets within a specified range.If a ranged a ack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can t a ack a target beyond this range.Some ranged a acks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges.  e smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your a ack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can t a ack a target beyond the long range.\n\nRANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT\nAiming a ranged a ack is more difficult when a foe is next to you.  en you make a ranged a ack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the a ack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn t incapacitated.\n\nMELEE ATTACKS\nA melee a ack allows you to a ack a foe within your reach. A melee a ack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee a ack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee a ack.Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus a ack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee a ack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee a acks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon a ack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-bu , or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your STR modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\n\nOPPORTUNITY ATTACKS\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who flees or passes by. Such a strike is called an opportunity a ack.You can make an opportunity a ack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity a ack, use your reaction to make one melee a ack against the provoking creature.  e a ack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\u000eYou can avoid provoking an opportunity a ack by taking the Disengage action. You also don t provoke an opportunity a ack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don t provoke an opportunity a ack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\n\nTWO-WEAPON FIGHTING\n en you take the A ack action and a ack with a light melee weapon held in one hand, you can use a bonus action to a ack with a different light melee weapon you hold in the other hand. You don t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus a ack, unless that modifier is negative.If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon instead of making a melee a ack with it.\n\nGRAPPLING\nUsing the A ack action, you can make a special melee a ack to grapple a creature. If you can make multiple a acks with the A ack action, this a ack replaces one of them. e target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an a ack roll: a STR (Athletics) check contested by the target s STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses which check to use). If you win the contest, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see Appendix).  e condition specifies what ends it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. It must succeed on a STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check contested by your STR (Athletics) check.Moving a Grappled Creature.  en you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\n\nSHOVING\nUsing the A ack action, you can make a special melee a ack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you can make multiple a acks with the A ack action, this a ack replaces one of them. e target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an a ack roll, you make a STR (Athletics) check contested by the target s STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses which check to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.43 Chaptier 2: Playing the Game\n\nDAMAGE AND HEALING\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds.  e thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\n\nHIT POINTS\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill.  ose with fewer hit points are more fragile.A creature s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from its hit point maximum down to 0.  is number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing. enever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points.  e loss of hit points has no effect on a creature s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\n\nTEMPORARY HIT POINTS\nSome spells and special abilities give you temporary hit points. Don t add these to your current hit points. Instead, think of them as a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protects you from injury. en you have temporary hit points and take damage, lose the temporary hit points first. Any le over damage carries over to your current hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.Because temporary hit points are separate from your current hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. You can be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.Healing can t restore temporary hit points, and you can t stack temporary hit points together. If you have a pool of temporary hit points and then get more from another source, decide whether to keep the ones you have or take the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.  ey can still absorb damage directed at you while you re unconscious, but only true healing can stabilize you.Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until depleted or you finish a long rest.\n\nDAMAGE ROLLS\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant \u000ea bonus to damage. A penalty might cause you to deal 0 damage, but you never deal negative damage. en a acking with a weapon, add your ability modifier the same modifier used for the a ack roll to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball, the player rolls damage once for all creatures caught in the blast.\n\nCRITICAL HITS\n en you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the a ack s damage against the target. Roll all of the a ack s damage dice twice and add them together.  en add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all damage dice at once.For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the a ack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue s Sneak A ack feature, roll those dice twice as well.\n\nDAMAGE TYPES\nDifferent a acks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types. e damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.Acid.  e corrosive spray of a black dragon s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.Bludgeoning. Blunt force a acks hammers, falling, constriction, and the like deal bludgeoning damage.Cold.  e infernal chill radiating from an ice devil s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon s breath deal cold damage.Fire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.Force. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon s breath deal lightning damage.Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain Undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers ma er and even the soul.Piercing. Puncturing and impaling a acks, including spears and monsters  bites, deal piercing damage.Poison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon s breath deal poison damage.Psychic. Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage.Black Flag Roleplaying44Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric s flame strike spell or an angel s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.Slashing. Swords, axes, and monsters  claws deal slashing damage. under. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\n\nDAMAGE RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.Resistance and then vulnerability are applied a er all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an a ack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage.  e creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5.  e 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n\nHEALING\nUnless it results in death, damage isn t permanent. Rest can restore a creature s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant. en a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature s hit points can t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points, not 8.A creature that dies can t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\n\nDROPPING TO 0 HIT POINTS\n en you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\n\nINSTANT DEATH\nMassive damage can kill you instantly.  en damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\u000eFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an a ack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, and 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\n\nFALLING UNCONSCIOUS\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see Appendix).  is unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\n\nDEATH SAVES\n enever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special save, called a death save, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saves, this one isn t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a save.Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die.Successes and failures don t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.  e number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.Rolling 1 or 20.  en you make a death save and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death save failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\n\nSTABILIZING A CREATURE\n e best way to help a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn t killed by a failed death save.You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and a empt to stabilize it with a successful DC 10 WIS (Medicine) check.A stable creature doesn t make death saves, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.  e creature stops being stable, and must start making death saves again if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn t healed regains 1 hit point a er 1d4 hours.\n\nMONSTERS AND DEATH\nMonsters generally die the instant they drop to 0 hit points, since tracking death saves for a dozen monsters can be tedious.Mighty villains and special NPCs are common exceptions, though.  e GM can decide to have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as PCs.45 Chaptier 2: Playing the GameKNOCKING A CREATURE OUT UNDERWATER COMBAT Sometimes an a acker wants to incapacitate a foe rather  en adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea than deal a killing blow.  en an a acker reduces a homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find creature to 0 hit points with a melee a ack, the a acker themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a can choose to knock the creature out instead of killing it. challenging environment.

You can t mount it if you don t have 15 feet of movement le  or if your speed is 0.If an effect moves your mount against its will while you re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same save with the same results.If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount and land on your feet as it falls. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet of it.\n\nCONTROLLING A MOUNT\n ile you re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, generally prefer to act independently.You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training.  e initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to devour a downed foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity a ack while you re on it, the a acker can target you or the mount."
