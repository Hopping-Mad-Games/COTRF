DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES\n Q: What is the average ability score for a person?\n A: The average ability score for a person is 10 in every ability score.\n\n5:\n C: METHOD ONE: ROLLING\n Q: How do you determine ability scores using the rolling method?\n A: Roll four d6s, discard the lowest die, and add the remaining three dice to get a total. Repeat this process five more times to get six totals between 3 and 18. Assign these numbers to the ability scores as desired. Finally, add 2 to one score of your choice that is 16 or below and add 1 to one score of your choice that is 17 or below.\n\n6:\n C: METHOD TWO: POINT-BUY\n Q: How do you determine ability scores using the point-buy method?\n A: Start with 32 points to spend on ability scores.

On your third failure, you die.\n\n17:\n C: DEATH SAVES\n Q: What happens if you roll a 1 or 20 on a death save?\n A: If you roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures.

If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\n\n19:\n C: STABILIZING A CREATURE\n Q: How can you stabilize a creature with 0 hit points?\n A: You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it with a successful DC 10 WIS (Medicine) check.\n\n20:\n C: MONSTERS AND DEATH\n Q: How do monsters typically die when they drop to 0 hit points?\n A: Monsters generally die the instant they drop to 0 hit points.\n1:\n C: KNOCKING A CREATURE OUT\n Q: What can an attacker do instead of killing a creature when reducing it to 0 hit points with a melee attack?\n A: The attacker can choose to knock the creature out, causing it to fall unconscious and become stable.\n\n2:\n C: MOUNTED COMBAT\n Q: What is required for a creature to serve as a mount?\n A: The creature must be at least one size larger than the attacker and have an appropriate anatomy.\n\n3:\n C: MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING\n Q: How much movement does it cost to mount or dismount a creature?\n A: It costs an amount of movement equal to half the attacker's speed.\n\n4:\n C: MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING\n Q: What happens if an effect moves the mount against its will while the attacker is on it?\n A: The attacker must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or fall off the mount, landing prone nearby.\n\n5:\n C: MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING\n Q: What happens if the attacker is knocked prone while mounted?\n A: The attacker must make the same DC 10 DEX save as above, with the same results.\n\n6:\n C: MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING\n Q: What can the attacker do if the mount is knocked prone?\n A: The attacker can use their reaction to dismount and land on their feet as the mount falls. Otherwise, they are dismounted and fall prone nearby.\n\n7:\n C: CONTROLLING A MOUNT\n Q: What are the two options the attacker has while mounted?\n A: The attacker can either control the mount or allow it to act independently.\n\n8:\n C: CONTROLLING A MOUNT\n Q: What type of creatures generally prefer to act independently?\n A: Intelligent creatures, such as dragons.\n\n9:\n C: CONTROLLING A MOUNT\n Q: What is required for the attacker to control a mount?\n A: The mount must have been trained to accept a rider.\n\n10:\n C: CONTROLLING A MOUNT\n Q: What happens to the mount's initiative when the attacker mounts it?\n A: The mount's initiative changes to match the attacker's.\n\n11:\n C: CONTROLLING A MOUNT\n Q: What action options does a controlled mount have?\n A: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.\n\n12:\n C: CONTROLLING A MOUNT\n Q: Can a controlled mount move and act on the turn it is mounted?\n A: Yes, it can.\n\n13:\n C: CONTROLLING A MOUNT\n Q: What happens if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while the attacker is on it?\n A: The attacker can target either themselves or the mount.\n\n14:\n C: UNDERWATER COMBAT\n Q: What disadvantage does a creature without a swimming speed have when making a melee weapon attack underwater?\n A: They have disadvantage on attack rolls unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\n\n15:\n C: UNDERWATER COMBAT\n Q: What is the maximum range for a ranged weapon attack underwater?\n A: The attack cannot hit a target beyond its normal range.\n\n16:\n C: UNDERWATER COMBAT\n Q: What disadvantage does a ranged weapon attack have even within normal range underwater?\n A: It has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).\n\n17:\n C: UNDERWATER COMBAT\n Q: What resistance do creatures and objects fully immersed in water have?\n A: They have resistance to fire damage.\n\n18:\n C: UNDERWATER COMBAT\n Q: What are some examples of challenging environments where underwater combat might occur?\n A: Pursuing sahuagin to their underwater homes, fighting off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or finding oneself in a flooded dungeon room.\n\n19:\n C: UNDERWATER COMBAT\n Q: Why might a creature choose to allow their mount to act independently?\n A: Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, generally prefer to act independently.\n\n20:\n C: UNDERWATER COMBAT\n Q: What happens if the attacker fails the DEX save when their mount is moved against its will or knocked prone?\n A: They fall off the mount, landing prone nearby."
